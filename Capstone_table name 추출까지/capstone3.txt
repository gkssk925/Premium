7	Receiver Characteristics
7.1	General
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE(s) with
an integral antenna only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each antenna port(s). UE with an
integral antenna(s) may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength requirements,
assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals
shall be applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used (diversity).
Unless otherwise stated, the test signal levels are defined at each antenna port, and specified in the respective sections
below. Any specific test conditions are defined in the paragraph for each test. Unless stated otherwise, power control of
the Downlink is OFF.
In general, the UE is set into the correct state in the "Initial conditions" part of the test, using normal SS signalling
procedures over the air interface under easy radio conditions to ensure reliable message exchange. In the "Test
procedure" part of the test, specific radio conditions are applied according to the test requirement and the desired
measurement is made or the desired response is tested.
The ACS, blocking, spurious emissions and intermodulation requirements in sections 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 are defined
for full band width signals i.e. for signals where all resource blocks are allocated for a specific user.
With the exception of Clause 7.3, the requirements shall be verified with the network signalling value NS_01
configured (Table 6.2.4.3-1).
All the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the UL reference measurement channels specified in Annexes A.2.2
and A.2.3, the DL reference measurement channels specified in Annex A.3.2 and using the set-up specified in Annex
C.3.1.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two component carriers (one
component carrier per sub-block), an in-gap test refers to the case when the interfering signal is located at a negative
offset with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the highest carrier frequency and located at a positive offset
with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the lowest carrier frequency.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two component carriers (one
component carrier per sub-block), an out-of-gap test refers to the case when the interfering signal(s) is (are) located at a
positive offset with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the highest carrier frequency, or located at a negative
offset with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the lowest carrier frequency.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two component carriers with
channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz (one component carrier per sub-block), the existing adjacent channel
selectivity requirements, in-band blocking requirements (for each case), and narrow band blocking requirements apply
for in-gap tests only if the corresponding interferer frequency offsets with respect to the two measured carriers satisfy
the following condition in relation to the sub-block gap size Wgap for at least one of these carriers j, j = 1,2, so that the
interferer frequency position does not change the nature of the core requirement tested:
Wgap ≥ 2?|FInterferer (offset),j| ? BWChannel(j)
where FInterferer (offset),j is the interferer frequency offset with respect to carrier j as specified in subclause 7.5.1A, subclause
7.6.1A and subclause 7.6.3A for the respective requirement and BWChannel(j) the channel bandwidth of carrier j. The
interferer frequency offsets for adjacent channel selectivity, each in-band blocking case and narrow- band blocking shall
be tested separately with a single in-gap interferer at a time.
For a ProSe UE that supports both ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication, the receiver
characteristics specified in clause 7 for ProSe Direct Communication shall apply.
For ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication on E-UTRA ProSe operating bands that correspond to
TDD E-UTRA operating bands as specified in clause 5.2D, the only additional requirement for ProSe specified in
clause 7.4.1D is applicable.
For CA tests, Cell ID = 0 applies to P-Cell, and Cell ID = n (where n is 1,2,3..) applies to S-Celln (where n is 1,2,3..),
respectively.
Parameters given in table 7.1-1 are used throughout this section for CA, unless otherwise stated by the test case.

For CA testing, unless otherwise stated, the logical carriers PCC / SCCs are mapped to physical frequencies as defined
in Table 7.1-2.

Note 1:	Notation CCi-CCj means PCC on component carrier CCi and SCC on
component carrier CCj, with CCi/j frequencies defined in the corresponding
intra-band contiguous / non-contiguous CA band in TS36.508 [7].
Note 2:	Notation Bi?Bj means PCC on component Band i and SCC on component
Band j, with single Band i/j frequencies defined in TS36.508 [7].
Note 3:	Applicable for UE declared capability of UL support (within CA operation) in
the individual bands. If UE does not support both PCC-SCC mappings, only
the supported mapping is applicable.
Note 4:	Applicable for TDD CA and FDD CA bands with UL frequency < DL
frequency.
Note 5:	Applicable for FDD CA bands with UL frequency > DL frequency and intra-
band non-contiguous CA bands with wider DL operating bandwidth than UL.

For testing of category 0 HD-FDD UE in FDD operating bands, the SS shall ensure downlink transmission is only
configured in downlink subframes and that UL grants are given to ensure UE is transmitting only in uplink subframes
throughout the test. The subframes reserved for uplink and downlink respectively are specified in the RMC definition in
Annex A.2 for uplink and Annex A.3 for downlink.
For ProSe testing, DRX configuration specified in Table 7.1-3 is used, so that Sidelink traffic takes place only in the
DRX off part of the DRX cycle.

NOTE:	For further information see clause 6.3.2 in TS 36.331.

For testing of category NB1 in all operation bands, standalone is used as default operation mode unless otherwise stated
by the test case.
7.2	Diversity characteristics
The requirements in Section 7 assume that the receiver is equipped with two Rx port as a baseline. These requirements
apply to all UE categories unless stated otherwise. Additional requirements apply for UE(s) equipped with four Rx
ports. With the exception of clause 7.9, all requirements shall be verified by using both (all) antenna ports
simultaneously.
NOTE 1:	for an operating band in which the UE can operate using up to four Rx ports, it suffices to verify for
conformance the additional requirements applicable for four Rx ports [except for REFSENS].
NOTE 2:	Implementation of 4 antenna ports for all operating bands supported by the UE is not mandated. For a
category 0 UE the requirements in Section 7 assume that the receiver is equipped with single Rx port.
For a category NB1 UE the requirements in Section 7 assume that the receiver is equipped with single Rx port.
7.3	Reference sensitivity level
Editor's note:	FDD/TDD aspects missing or not yet determined:
- The Maximum Sensitivity Degradation figures for large transmission configurations are not finalised in the core
specification.
- This clause is also incomplete for CA_42A-46A and CA_7A-8A-20.
- ΔRIB,c is in square brackets (awaiting for RAN4 decision).
- Clarification to the use of signalling the non-default Tx-Rx separation of 295MHz for Band 70 testing is under
discussion.
7.3.1	Test purpose
To verify the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified reference measurement
channel, under conditions of low signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the effective coverage area of an
e-NodeB.
7.3.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
7.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3.3-1 and Table 7.3.3-2.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5Note 2:
	The Reference measurement channel is A.3.2 with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	For the UE which supports both Band 3 and Band 9 the reference sensitivity
level is FFS.
Note 5:	For the UE which supports both Band 11 and Band 21 the reference sensitivity
level is FFS.
Note 6:	6 indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier
frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.
Note 7:	For a UE that support both Band 18 and Band 26, the reference sensitivity level
for Band 26 applies for the applicable channel bandwidths.

For UE(s) equipped with 4 antenna ports, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.3-1 shall be
modified by the amount given in ΔRIB,4R in Table 7.3.3-1a for the applicable E-UTRA bands..
Table 7.3.3-1a: ΔRIB,4R

The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement specified in Table 7.3.3-1 (two antenna ports) and Table
7.3.3-1a (four antenna ports) shall be met for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in
Table 7.3.3-2.
NOTE:	Table 7.3.3-2 is intended for conformance tests and does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions
of the network, where the number of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically
constrained by other factors. Typical receiver sensitivity performance with HARQ retransmission enabled
and using a residual BLER metric relevant for e.g. Speech Services is given in the Annex G of TS 36.101
[2] (informative).
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration with the uplink in one or two E-UTRA bands,
the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.3-1 and Table 7.3.3-1a shall be increased by the amount
given in ΔRIB,c in Table 7.3.3-1A, Table 7.3.3-1B and Table 7.3.3-1C for the applicable E-UTRA bands.

NOTE 1:	The above additional tolerances are only applicable for the E-UTRA operating
bands that belong to the supported inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations
NOTE 2:	The above additional tolerances also apply in intra-band and non-aggregated
operation for the supported E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the
supported inter-band carrier aggregation configurations.
NOTE 3:	In case the UE supports more than one of the above 2DL inter-band carrier
aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA operating band belongs to more than
one 2DL inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the
applicable additional tolerance shall be the average of the 2DL tolerances in
Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that
operating band among the supported 2DL CA configurations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
tolerance among the different supported 2DL carrier aggregation configurations
involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the
applicable additional tolerance shall be the maximum 2DL tolerance in Table
7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported 2DL CA
configurations
NOTE 4:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink in
one E-UTRA band and without simultaneous Rx/Tx.
NOTE 5:	Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the
above 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the
tolerances are the same, the value applies to the band. If the tolerances are
different, the applicable additional 3DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the
maximum tolerance among the different supported 3DL carrier aggregation
configurations involving such band shall be applied.
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the
applicable additional 3DL tolerance shall be the maximum tolerance above
that applies for that operating band among the supported 3DL CA
configurations.
NOTE 6:	The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands
that belong to the supported highest order inter-band carrier aggregation
configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to
a supported lower order CA configuration.
NOTE 7:	Applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation without
simultaneous Rx/Tx.
NOTE 8:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink
active in the FDD band.
NOTE 9:	For Band 28, the requirements only apply for the restricted frequency range
specified for this CA configuration (Table 5.2A-2).
NOTE 10:	The requirement is applied for UE transmitting on the frequency range of 2545-
2690MHz.
NOTE 11:	The requirement is applied for UE transmitting on the frequency range of 2496-
2545MHz.
NOTE 12:	For UE supporting E-UTRA band 42, 43 or 48 and CA configurations including
Band 42, 43 or 48, the applicable ΔRIB,c in Band 42, 43, or 48 is the max(Band
42 ΔRIB,c , Band 43 ΔRIB,c, Band 48 ΔRIB,c).
NOTE 13: Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink
active in Band 8.

NOTE:	To meet the ?RIB,c requirements for CA_20A-28A state-of-the-art filter combiner technology is needed.

bands that belong to the supported inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations.
NOTE 2:	The above additional tolerances also apply in intra-band and non-aggregated
operation for the supported E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the
supported inter-band carrier aggregation configurations.
NOTE 3:	Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the
above 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the
tolerances are the same, the value applies to the band. If the tolerances are
different, the applicable additional 3DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
tolerance among the different supported 3DL carrier aggregation configurations
involving such band shall be applied.
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable
additional 3DL tolerance shall be the maximum tolerance above that applies for
that operating band among the supported 3DL CA configurations.
NOTE 4:	The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands
that belong to the supported highest order inter-band carrier aggregation
configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to
a supported lower order CA configuration.
NOTE 5:	The requirement is specified for the frequency range of 2545-2690MHz.
NOTE 6:	The requirement is specified for the frequency range of 2496-2545MHz.

7.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.3.4.1-1 and 7.3.4.1-2. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the Downlink signal level to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3.5-1. Send continuously
uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to ensure the UE transmits
PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
4.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level (Table 7.3.5-2)
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	For the UE which supports both Band 3 and Band 9 the reference sensitivity
level is FFS.
Note 5:	For the UE which supports both Band 11 and Band 21 the reference sensitivity
level is FFS.
Note 6:	6 indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier
frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.
Note 7:	For a UE that support both Band 18 and Band 26, the reference sensitivity level
for Band 26 applies for the applicable channel bandwidths.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations
NOTE 1:	The relation to the received PSD is   with NRB is the transmission
bandwidth configuration according to Table 5.4.2-1.
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement specified in Table 7.3.5-1 shall be met for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3.5-2.
NOTE 2:	Table 7.3.5-2 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number of
uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.

NOTE 1:	The transmitter shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5
NOTE 2:	Reference measurement channel is A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
NOTE 3:	The signal power is specified per port.

7.3A	Reference sensitivity level for CA
Editor's note: The Test Requirements for CA_2A-30A are missing.
7.3A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3.3-1, Table 7.3.3-1a and Table 7.3.3-2.
The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active and one of the uplink carriers
active. The uplink resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the primary downlink operating band but
confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1). The primary
downlink operating band is the downlink band of the active uplink operating band. The UE shall meet the requirements
specified in subclause 7.3.3 with the following exceptions.
For the UE that supports any of the E-UTRA CA configurations given in Table 7.3A.0-0a, exceptions to the
aforementioned requirements are allowed when the uplink is active in a lower-frequency band and is within a specified
frequency range such that transmitter harmonics fall within the downlink transmission bandwidth assigned in a higher
band as noted in Table 7.3A.0-0a. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the requirements specified in Table 7.3A.0-
0a and Table 7.3A.0-0b.

channel bandwidth in Band 1.
NOTE 5:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the
lower edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band
3 is ≥ 60 MHz. For each channel bandwidth in Band 3, the requirement applies regardless of
channel bandwidth in Band 1.
NOTE 6:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 18 and the downlink channels in
Band 28 are confined within the restricted frequency range specified for this CA configuration
(Table 5.2A-2). For each channel bandwidth in Band 28, the requirement applies regardless of
channel bandwidth in Band 18.
NOTE 7:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 19 and the downlink channels in
Band 28 are allocated at the middle of the restricted frequency range specified for this CA
configuration (Table 5.2A-2). For each channel bandwidth in Band 28, the requirement applies
regardless of channel bandwidth in Band 19.
NOTE 8:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier
aggregation configured.

NOTE 1:	The transmitter shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5A.
NOTE 2:	Reference measurement channel is A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
NOTE 3:	The signal power is specified per port.
NOTE 4:	These requirements apply regardless of the channel bandwidth and the location of UL band.
NOTE 5: 	The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel
bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz.
NOTE 6: 	The antenna isolation for MSD calculation is assumed as 10 dB. For conducted mode REFSENS test
such antenna isolation is not observed as the antennas are disconnected. Additionally antenna isolation
assumption is under discussion depending on the frequency range.
NOTE 7:	These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission
bandwidth of the aggressor (lower) band for which the 2nd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink
transmission bandwidth of a victim (higher) band and a range ?FHD above and below the edge of this
downlink transmission bandwidth. The value ?FHD depends on the E-UTRA configuration: ?FHD = 10 MHz
for CA_3A-42A, CA_3A-42C, CA_1A-3A-42A, CA_1A-3A-42C, CA_3A-19A-42A, CA_3A-19A-42C and
CA_1A-3A-19A-42A, CA 3A-41A-42A.
NOTE 8:	The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of the aggressor (lower) band (superscript LB) such
that  in MHz and   with  carrier
frequency in the victim (higher) band in MHz and   the channel bandwidth configured in the lower
band.
NOTE 9:	The requirements are only applicable to channel bandwidths with a carrier frequency at
  MHz offset from   in the victim (higher band) with
 , where and are the channel
bandwidths configured in the aggressor (lower) and victim (higher) bands in MHz, respectively.
NOTE 10:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink in one E-UTRA band and
without simultaneous Rx/Tx.
NOTE 11:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation
configured.
NOTE 12:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge
of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60 MHz. For
each channel bandwidth in Band 3 and Band 41, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth
in Band 1.
NOTE 13:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge
of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60 MHz. For
each channel bandwidth in Band 3 and Band 41, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth
in Band 1.
NOTE 14:	The B41 requirements also apply to the supported CA_1A-41A.
NOTE 15:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge
of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60 MHz. For
each channel bandwidth other than Band 1, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in
Band 1
NOTE 16:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge
of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60 MHz. For
each channel bandwidth other than Band 1, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in
Band 1.
NOTE 17:	The B41 requirements are modified by -0.1dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel
bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz.

Table 7.3A.0-0eC specifies the Band 46 reference measurement exclusion region for different licensed component
carriers and channel bandwidth. The exclusion region is defined according to the licensed component carrier channel
bandwidth. The UL configurations to be adopted for the test are specified in Table 7.3.3-2. The exclusion region in
Table 7.3A.0-0eC is specified for the case of 20MHz channel bandwidth in Band 46. The exclusion region for 10MHz
channel bandwidth in Band 46 is FFS.

NOTE 1:	Even though UL harmonic does not fall directly into Band 46 the exclusion region still applies.
NOTE 2:	The centre of the exclusion region is obtained by multiplying the UL channel centre frequency by
the harmonic order.

In all cases for single uplink inter-band CA, unless given by Table 7.3.3-3 for the band with the active uplink carrier,
the applicable reference sensitivity requirements shall be verified with the network signalling value NS_01 (Table
6.2.4.3-1) configured.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band (up to four downlinks) and the uplink
assigned to two E-UTRA bands the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3.3-1, Table
7.3.3-1a and Table 7.3.3-2. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active
and both of the uplink carriers active.
For E-UTRA CA configurations with uplink and downlink assigned to two E-UTRA bands given in Table 7.3A.0-0f the
reference sensitivity is defined only for the specific uplink and downlink test points which are specified in Table
7.3A.0-0f. For E-UTRA CA configurations with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands and downlink assigned to three
E-UTRA bands given in Table 7.3.1A-0g the reference sensitivity is defined only for the specific uplink and downlink
test points which are specified in Table 7.3.1A-0g. For these test points the reference sensitivity requirement specified
in Table 7.3.3-1 and Table 7.3.3-1a are relaxed by the amount of the corresponding parameter MSD given in Table
7.3A.0-0f and Table 7.3A.0-0g.
The allowed exceptions defined in Table 7.3A.0-0a and Table 7.3A.0-0b for inter-band carrier aggregation with a single
active uplink are also applicable for dual uplink operation.

NOTE 2:	RBSTART = 0
NOTE 3:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.3-1, Table 7.3.3-1a, Table 7.3.3-1A, Table 7.3.3-1B, Table 7.3.3-1C, Table 7.3A.0-0h and table
7.3A.0-1. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the power levels in Table 7.3.1-1 and
Table 7.3.3-1a also apply for an SCC assigned in the unpaired part. The requirement is verified using an uplink CA
configuration with the largest number of carriers supported by the UE. Table 7.3A.0-1 specifies the maximum number
of allocated uplink resource blocks for which the intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation reference sensitivity
requirement shall be met. The PCC and SCC allocations as defined in Table 7.3.3-2 and form a contiguous allocation
where TX?RX frequency separations of the component carriers are as defined in Table 5.3-1. In case downlink CA
configuration has additional SCC(s) compared to uplink CA configuration those are configured furthers away from
uplink band. For UE(s) supporting one uplink carrier, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance with
Table 7.3.3-2 and the downlink PCC carrier centre frequency shall be configured closer to uplink operating band than
any of the downlink SCC centre frequency. Unless given by Table 7.3.3-3, the reference sensitivity requirements shall
be verified with the network signalling value NS_01 (Table 6.2.4.3-1) configured.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two uplink and downlink carriers the reference sensitivity is
defined to be met with both downlink and uplink carriers activated. The downlink PCC and SCC minimum
requirements for reference sensitivity power level as specified in Table 7.3.3-1, Table 7.3.3-1a, Table 7.3.3-1A, Table
7.3.3-1B and Table 7.3.3-1C are increased by amount of ΔR2UL_PCC and ΔR2UL_SCC which are defined in Table 7.3A.0-4
when uplink PCC and SCC allocations are according to the Table 7.3A.0-4.

NOTE 1:	The transmitter shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5A.
NOTE 2:	All combinations of channel bandwidths defined in Table 5.4.2A.1-3.
NOTE 3:	All applicable sub-block gap sizes.
NOTE 4:	The PCC allocation is same as Transmission bandwidth configuration NRB as defined in Table 5.4.2-1.
NOTE 5:	The SCC allocation is same as Transmission bandwidth configuration NRB as defined in Table 5.4.2-1.

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguous sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and up to three uplink
carriers (up to two contiguously aggregated carriers per band), the requirement is defined with an uplink configuration
in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is active in a band supporting two non-contiguous component
carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink (up to two contiguously aggregated uplink carriers) is active in a band
supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when an uplink is active in a band
supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than the
downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component
carriers. The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL operating band
when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting non-contiguous aggregation of up to two sub-blocks. For these uplink
configurations, the UE shall meet the reference sensitivity requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation of two downlink sub-blocks, the requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for the
contiguously aggregated downlink carriers and for any remaining component carrier(s) the requirements specified in
subclause 7.3.3. For the two component carriers within the same band, ?RIBNC = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table
7.3A.0-3) when the uplink is active in another band. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the
requirements for the downlinks shall be met with all uplink carriers active in each band capable of UL operation. For
component carriers configured in Band 46, the said requirements for intra-band carrier aggregation of downlink carriers
are replaced by the requirements in Table 7.3A.0-0eA for the uplink in any band other than band 46 with the uplink
configuration specified in Table 7.3.3-2. Unless given by Table 7.3.3-3, the reference sensitivity requirements shall be
verified with the network signalling value NS_01 (Table 6.2.4.3-1) configured.
For the UE that supports any of combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation given in Table 7.3A.0-5,
exceptions to the aforementioned requirements are allowed when the uplink is active in a lower-frequency band and is
within a specified frequency range such that transmitter harmonics fall within the downlink transmission bandwidth
assigned in a higher band as noted in Table 7.3A.0-5. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the requirements
specified in Table 7.3A.0-5 and Table 7.3A.0-6.

NOTE 1:	refers to the UL resource blocks, which shall be centred within the transmission
bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth.
NOTE 2:	the UL configuration applies regardless of the channel bandwidth of the low band unless
the UL resource blocks exceed that specified in Table 7.3.3-2 for the uplink bandwidth in
which case the allocation according to Table 7.3.3-2 applies.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101[2] clause 7.3.1 and 7.3.1A.
7.3A.1	Reference sensitivity level for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA)
7.3A.1.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of UE that support CA to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified reference
measurement channel, under conditions of low signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the effective coverage area of an
e-NodeB.
7.3A.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA.
7.3A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.3A.0.
7.3A.1.4	Test description
7.3A.1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.3A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1
for UE supporting two uplink carriers is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg, only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.80 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.3A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.3A.1.4.3.
7.3A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.1.5-1.
Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5 for one uplink carrier and in subclause 6.2.5A for two uplink
carriers.
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.

7.3A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
7.3A.1.5	Test requirement
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3A.1.5-1 and table 7.3A.1.5-2.
Table 7.3A.1.5-1: Reference sensitivity QPSK PREFSENS for intra-band

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for intra-band specified in Table 7.3A.1.5-1 shall be met for
each uplink CA configurations less than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3A.1.5-2.
NOTE:	Table 7.3A.1.5-2 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number
of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3.3-2 for
UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.
Note 4:	For CA_70C all test frequency IDs shall be tested according to table 4.3.1.1.70A-1, in TS 36.508 [7].

7.3A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.2.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Tables 7.3A.1.5-1
to 7.3A.1.5-7. Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information
to the UE to ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.2.4.3	Message contents
Same as in clause 7.3A.1.4.3.
7.3A.2.5	Test requirement
Same as in clause 7.3A.1.5 with the following test requirement defined in Table 7.3A.2.5-1 additions.

7.3A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause 7.3A3.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.3.5-1.
Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6 with the following exceptions.
7.3A.3.4.3.1	Message contents exceptions (network signalled value "NS_01")
Message contents according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6 can be used without exceptions.
7.3A.3.4.3.2	Message contents exceptions (network signalled value "NS_06")
1. Information element additionalSpectrumEmission is set to NS_06. This can be set in the
SystemInformationblockType2 as part of the cell broadcast message. This exception indicates that the UE shall
meet the additional spurious emission requirement for a specific deployment scenario.
Table 7.3A.3.4.3.2-1: SystemInformationBlockType2: Additional spurious emissions test requirement

7.3A.3.5	Test requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters specified in
Tables 7.3A.3.5-1 and Table 7.3A.3.5-2 (originated from single carrier Tables 7.3.5-1 and 7.3.5-2). The reference
sensitivity is defined to be met with both downlink component carriers active and either of the uplink component
carriers active.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level (Table 7.3A.3.5-2)
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD/FS3 as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1/A.5.3.1.
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 3rd harmonic of the low band is within
transmission bandwidth, as specified Note 5 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 5:	5 indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier frequency of the assigned E-
UTRA channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.
Note 6:	Reference sensitivity for the case that the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the
lower edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is <
60 MHz
Note 7:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within
transmission bandwidth, as specified Note 9 and 10 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 8:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within
transmission bandwidth, as specified Note 11 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 9:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 19 and the downlink channels in Band 28
are allocated at the middle of the restricted frequency range specified for this CA configuration (Table
5.2A-2). For each channel bandwidth in Band 28, the requirement applies regardless of channel
bandwidth in Band 19.
Note 10:	The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel
bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz.
Note 11:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 41.
Note 12:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 3.
Note 13:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 5th harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 15 and 16 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 14:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1.
Note 15:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 40.
Note 16:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 4th harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 12 and 13 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 17:	The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission
bandwidth of the lower band for which the transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission
bandwidth of the higher band and a range ?FHD from lower and higher frequency of the uplink
transmission bandwidth multiplied by the harmonic order. Negative ?FHD reduces the REFSENS
exclusion range while positive ?FHD extends the range. ?FHD = [30] MHz for the E-UTRA configuration
which has 2nd harmonic issue. ?FHD = 15 MHz for the E-UTRA configuration which has 3rd harmonic
issue. ?FHD = [10] MHz for the E-UTRA configuration which has 4th harmonic issue. ?FHD = [-20] MHz
for the E-UTRA configuration which has 6th harmonic issue. ?FHD = [-30] MHz for the E-UTRA
configuration which has 7th harmonic issue. ?FHD = [-40] MHz for the E-UTRA configuration which has
for 8th harmonic issue. For band combinations including more than one licensed band with band 46,
the value ?FHD depends on which licensed band is used for uplink transmission.
Note 18:	The value ?FHD in Note 17 shall be scaled as ?FHD *(NRB/100) according to the uplink configuration
defined in Table 7.3A.3.5-2.
Note 19:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation
configured.
Note 20:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 28.
Note 21:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 7.
Note 22:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 42.
Note 23:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 8.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for inter-band specified in Table 7.3A.3.5-1 shall be met for
an uplink CA configurations than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3A.3.5-2.
NOTE:	Table 7.3A.3.5-2 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number
of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration,
which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL
operating band.
Note 3:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 4:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 5:	Not applicable if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation
configured.
Note 6:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation
configured.
Note 7:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 1 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 8:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 1 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 9:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 2 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.

7.3A.4.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A4.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.4.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.4.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.4.5-1.
Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level.
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with
one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port.
Note 4:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in
the band with carrier aggregation configured.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for intra-band non-contiguous specified in Table 7.3A.4.5-1
shall be met for an uplink CA configurations equal to that specified in Table 7.3A.4.4.1-1.
NOTE:	Table 7.3A.4.4.1-1 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the
number of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.

7.3A.5	Reference sensitivity level for 3DL CA
Editor’s note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	TR 36.905 test point analysis for CA_28A-40C is missing, meaning it is not yet determined if testing of
fallback configuration CA_28A_40A can be skipped.-	TR 36.905 test point analysis for CA_7A-42A-
42A is missing, meaning it is not yet determined if testing of fallback configuration CA_7A_42A can be
skipped.
7.3A.5.1	Test purpose
Same as in clause 7.3A.1.1.
7.3A.5.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band contiguous
CA, or 3DL with Inter-band CA, or 3DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA, or 3DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 3DL with FDD-TDD CA.
7.3A.5.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.3A.0.
7.3A.5.4	Test description
7.3A.5.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1 through table 5.4.2A.1-2a. All of these configurations shall be
tested with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.3A.5.4.1-1 through table
7.3A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band contiguous & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table,
otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test
Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use the Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	Inter-band & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual
band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41D, X=41
Note 6:	Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-19A,X=1,Y=3,Z=19
Note 7:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration, e.g. for CA_1C-3A, X=1,Y=3, for
CA_1A_42C, X=1,Y=42.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose for testing the
Combination with maximum NRB_PCC and then select maximum NRB_SCC1 for the chosen NRB_PCC

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use Default
Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X and Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-5A,X=2,Y=5 or Y=5, X =2
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-41A,X=41.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: Configuration for the low band for which the 3rd harmonic is within transmission bandwidth of the high band, as specified in Table 7.3A.0-0a Note 5.
Note 9:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such
combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.
Note 10:	Not applicable if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.
Note 11:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.
Note 12:	Applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 13:	Not applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 14:	Not applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 1 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 15:	Applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 2 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 16:	Not applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 2 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 17	Not applicable if for Intra-band non-contiguous only Bandwidth Combination Set 3 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.55 if the UE supports
2 Rx antennas or Figure A.80 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in at least one band within the CA configuration.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.3A.5.4.1-1 through
Table7.3A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.3A.5.4.3.
7.3A.5.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3A.5.4.1-1 through Table7.3A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.5.4.1-1 through Table7.3A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and
SCCs. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.5.5-1
through Table7.3A.5.5-7. Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling
information to the UE to ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput
measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.5.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCCs configuration there
are no additional message contents.
7.3A.5.5	Test requirement
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3A.5.5-1. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active
and one of the uplink carriers active.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3A.5.5-3 (originated from single carrier
Tables 7.3.5-1). The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active and one of
the uplink carriers active.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level (Table 7.3A.5.5-4)
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	Reference sensitivity for the case that the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower
edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60 MHz.
Note 5:	Reference sensitivity for the case that the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower
edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60 MHz.
Note 6:	6 indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA
channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.
Note 7:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 18 and the downlink channels in Band 28 are
confined within the restricted frequency range specified for this CA configuration (Table 5.2A-2).
Note 8:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 3rd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 5 and 6 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 9:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 9 and 10 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 10:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 11 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 11:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 19 and the downlink channels in Band 28 are
allocated at the middle of the restricted frequency range specified for this CA configuration (Table 5.2A-2). For
each channel bandwidth in Band 28, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in Band 19.
NOTE 12:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge of
the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60 MHz. For each
channel bandwidth in Band 3 and Band 41, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in Band
1.
NOTE 13:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge of
the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60 MHz. For each
channel bandwidth in Band 3 and Band 41, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in Band
1.
NOTE 14:	The B41 requirements also apply to the supported CA_1A-41A.
NOTE 15:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 or Band 8.
NOTE 16:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 3 or Band 8.
NOTE 17:	The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel
bandwidth is within 2545-2690MHz.
NOTE 18:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 41.
NOTE 19:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 3.
NOTE 20:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.
NOTE 21:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in a lower-frequency band and is within a specified
frequency range such that transmitter harmonics fall within the downlink transmission bandwidth assigned in a
higher band.
NOTE 22:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 42.
NOTE 23:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink in one E-UTRA band and without
simultaneous Rx/Tx.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the above 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations and an E-UTRA operating band belongs to more than one 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the tolerances are the same, the value applies
to the band. If the tolerances are different, the applicable additional 3DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum tolerance among the different
supported 3DL carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional 3DL tolerance shall be
the maximum tolerance above that applies for that operating band among the supported 3DL CA configurations
The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported highest order
inter-band carrier aggregation configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to a
supported lower order CA configuration.
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for inter-band specified in Table 7.3A.5.5-3 shall be met for
an uplink CA configurations than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3.5-2.
NOTE:	Table 7.3A.5.5-4 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number
of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.
Table 7.3A.5.5-4: Void
For combinations of intra-band contiguous and inter-band carrier aggregation with three downlink carriers and one
uplink carrier assigned to one E-UTRA band the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3A.5.5-5. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active
and one of the uplink carriers active.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level (Table 7.3A.5.5-4)
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port
Note 4:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 9 and 10 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 5:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 2nd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 11 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 6:	6indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA
channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.
Note 7:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 5th harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 15 and 16 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 8:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 4th harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 12 and 13 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
Note 9:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge of
the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60 MHz. For each
channel bandwidth in Band 3, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in Band 1.
Note 10:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower edge of
the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60 MHz. For each
channel bandwidth in Band 3, the requirement applies regardless of channel bandwidth in Band 1.
Note 11:	The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel
bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz.
Note 12:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 3.
Note 13:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 40.
Note 14:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 41.
Note 15:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 28.
Note 16:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.

For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band carrier aggregation with three downlink carriers and one
uplink carrier assigned to one E-UTRA band the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3A.5.5-6. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active
and one of the uplink carriers active.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching
Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use the Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A,X=1,Y=3.
Note 4:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity
according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 5:	Test frequency for each CA configuration shall follow Table 7.3A.0-0f. If test configurations of each ID in a CA
configuration are same, test frequency shall follow the order of Table 7.3A.0-0f.
Note 6:	Not applicable if the UE only supports Bandwidth Combination Set 1.

7.3A.6.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.6.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.6.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.6.5-1.
Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.6.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
7.3A.6.5	Test requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters specified in
Tables 7.3A.6.5-1 (originated from single carrier Tables 7.3.5-1). The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with
both downlink component carriers active and both of the uplink component carriers active.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration,
which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL
operating band.

7.3A.7.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A7.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.3A.7.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.7.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.7.5-1.
Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7. 	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.7.4.3	Message contents
Same as in clause 7.3A.4.4.3.
7.3A.7.5	Test requirement
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two uplink carriers, the throughput of each downlink component
carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.3.2 with parameters specified in Table 7.3A.7.5-1.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to maximum output power level
Note 2:	The reference measurement channel is specified in A.3.2 with
one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1
Note 3:	The signal power is specified per port

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied.
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 7.3.3-1A that would apply for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations.

7.3A.9	Reference sensitivity level for 4DL CA
Editor’s note: Following aspects missing or not yet determined:
-	Reference sensitivity QPSK PREFSENS has defined and made for some CA bands, some of are incomplete.
7.3A.9.1	Test purpose
Same as in clause 7.3A.1.1.
7.3A.9.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 4DL with Inter-band CA, or 4DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA or 4DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 4DL with
Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 4DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.
7.3A.9.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.3A.0.
7.3A.9.4	Test description
7.3A.9.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1 through table 5.4.2A.1-2a. All of these configurations shall be
tested with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.3A.9.4.1-1 through table
7.3A.9.4.1-2 as appropriate. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band contiguous & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use
the Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41E, X=41.
Note 6: 	Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-7A-8A,X=1,Y=3,Z=7,R=8.
Note 7: 	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_3C-7A-28A, X=3,Y=7 and Z=28.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose for testing the Combination with maximum NRB_PCC and
then select maximum NRB_SCC1 for the chosen NRB_PCC.
Note 10:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose the Combination with NRB_PCC = NRB_SCC1 for
testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_PCC for testing.
Note 11:	Test points that fulfil criteria of Note 4 in Table 7.3A.5.5-3.
Note 12:	Only Band 1 and Band 42 need to be tested and Band 3 does not need to be tested.
Note 13:	Band 3:	fUL = 1720MHz (NUL = 19300), fDL = 1815MHz (NDL = 1300)
Band 42:	fUL/DL = 3440MHz (NUL/DL = 41990)
Note 14:	Only Band 1 and Band 3 need to be tested and Band 42 does not need to be tested.
Note 15:	Band 3:	fUL = 1775MHz (NUL = 19850), fDL = 1870MHz (NDL = 1850)
Band 42:	fUL/DL = 3520MHz (NDL = 42790)
Note 16:	Band 42:	fUL/DL for SCC1 = 3430.2MHz (NUL/DL = 41892), fUL/DL for SCC2 = 3450MHz (NUL/DL = 42090)
Note 17:	Band 42:	fUL/DL for SCC1 = 3500.2MHz (NUL/DL = 42592), fUL/DL for SCC2 = 3520MHz (NUL/DL = 42790)
Note 18:	Band 12:	fUL = 706.7 MHz (NUL = 23087), fDL = 736.7 MHz (NDL = 5087)
Band 4:	fDL = 2120.1 MHz (NDL = 2051)
Note 19:	Band 12:	fUL = 710.9 MHz (NUL = 23129), fDL = 740.9 MHz (NDL = 5129)
Band 4:	fDL = 2132.7 MHz (NDL = 2177)

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the
table. Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X, Y, Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A,X=2,Y=4,Z=12.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-41A-41A,X=41.
Note 7:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-4A,X=2,Y=4.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported,
choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.
Note 10:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration. (This note is not applicable for any existing test point and only reserved for future use)
Note 11:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 12:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 1 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration. (This note is not applicable for any existing test point and only reserved for future use)
Note 13:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 1 is supported by the UE for the CA Configuration.
Note 14:	Not applicable if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.
Note 15:	Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured.


1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.55 if the UE supports
2 Rx antennas or Figure A.80 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in at least one band within the CA configuration..
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.3A.9.4.1-1 through
Table7.3A.9.4.1-6 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.3A.9.4.3.
7.3A.9.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.3A.9.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3A.9.4.1-1 through Table7.3A.9.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3A.9.4.1-1 through Table7.3A.9.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and
SCCs. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3A.9.5-1
through Table7.3A.9.5-7. Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling
information to the UE to ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the Throughput
measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.3A.9.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCCs configuration there
are no additional message contents.
7.3A.9.5	Test requirement
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput of each component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3A.9.5-1. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink component carriers active
and one of the uplink carriers active.

NOTE 5:	These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission
bandwidth of the aggressor (lower) band for which the 2nd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink
transmission bandwidth of a victim (higher) band and a range ?FHD above and below the edge of this
downlink transmission bandwidth. The value ?FHD depends on the E-UTRA configuration: ?FHD = 10
MHz for CA_3A-42A, CA_3A-42C, CA_1A-3A-42A, CA_1A-3A-42C, CA_3A-19A-42A, CA_3A-19A-42C,
CA_1A-3A-19A-42A and CA_1A-3A-19A-42C.
NOTE 6:	The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of the aggressor (lower) band (superscript LB)
such that  in MHz and   with
carrier frequency in the victim (higher) band in MHz and   the channel bandwidth configured in
the lower band.
NOTE 7:	The requirements are only applicable to channel bandwidths with a carrier frequency at
  MHz offset from   in the victim (higher band) with
 , where and are the channel
bandwidths configured in the aggressor (lower) and victim (higher) bands in MHz, respectively.
NOTE 8:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower
edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is < 60
MHz. For each channel bandwidth in the bands other than Band 1, the requirement applies regardless
of channel bandwidth in Band 1.
NOTE 9:	These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the separation between the lower
edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is ≥ 60
MHz. For each channel bandwidth in the bands other than Band 1, the requirement applies regardless
of channel bandwidth in Band 1.
NOTE 10:	Reference sensitivity for the high band for which the 3rd harmonic of the low band is within transmission
bandwidth, as specified Note 5 and 6 in Table 7.3A.0-0a.
NOTE 11:	These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission
bandwidth of a low band for which the 3rd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission
bandwidth of a high band.
NOTE 12:	The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of a low band (superscript LB) such that
 in MHz and   with  the carrier
frequency of a high band in MHz and   the channel bandwidth configured in the low band.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the above 4DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations and an E-UTRA operating band belongs to more than one 4DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the tolerances are the same, the value applies
to the band. If the tolerances are different, the applicable additional 4DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum tolerance among the different
supported 4DL carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional 4DL tolerance shall be
the maximum tolerance above that applies for that operating band among the supported 4DL CA configurations
The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported highest order
inter-band carrier aggregation configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to a
supported lower order CA configuration.
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for inter-band specified in Table 7.3A.9.5-3 shall be met for
an uplink CA configurations than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3.5-2.
NOTE:	Table 7.3A.9.5-4 does not necessarily reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number
of uplink and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by other factors.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band contiguous & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use the Default Test Settings test
points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41F, X=41.
Note 6: 	Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R,S correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-7A-20A-42A,X=1,Y=3,Z=7,R=20,S=42.
Note 7: 	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_3C-7A-28A, X=3,Y=7 and Z=28.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose for testing the Combination with maximum NRB_PCC and then select maximum
NRB_SCC1 for the chosen NRB_PCC.
Note 10:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose the Combination with NRB_PCC = NRB_SCC1 for testing. If no such
combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_PCC for testing.
Note 11:	Test points that fulfil criteria of Note 4 in Table 7.3A.5.5-3.
Note 12:	Only Band 1 and Band 42 need to be tested and Band 3 does not need to be tested.
Note 13:	Only Band 1 and Band 3 need to be tested and Band 42 does not need to be tested.
Note 14:	Band 42:	fUL/DL for SCC1 = 3430.2MHz (NUL/DL = 41892), fUL/DL for SCC2 = 3450MHz (NUL/DL = 42090)
Note 15:	Band 42:	fUL/DL for SCC1 = 3500.2MHz (NUL/DL = 42592), fUL/DL for SCC2 = 3520MHz (NUL/DL = 42790)

Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the above 5DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations and an E-UTRA operating band belongs to more than one 5DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the tolerances are the same, the value applies
to the band. If the tolerances are different, the applicable additional 5DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum tolerance among the different
supported 5DL carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional 5DL tolerance shall be
the maximum tolerance above that applies for that operating band among the supported 5DL CA configurations
The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported highest order
inter-band carrier aggregation configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to a
supported lower order CA configuration.
The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement for inter-band specified in Table 7.3A.10.5-2 shall be met for
an uplink CA configurations than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3.5-2.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations the ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA operating
band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 7.3.3-1A, truncated to one decimal place that would apply for that operating
band among the supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and
high band DL (i.e. bands listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a), then the maximum tolerance among the different supported
carrier aggregation configurations involving such band shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the

1.	SS shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to configure DRX. Message contents exceptions
(only those marked with "…Step 1…" ) are defined in clause 7.3D.1.4.3.
2. The UE shall transmit RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
3.	Initialise the variables Ptot and Pok as 0.
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3D.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.3D.1.4.1-1. When the UE has no payload data to send, it transmits uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
6.	SS transmits PSDCH to transmit the SL RMC according to Table 7.3D.1.4.1-1. Set the Sidelink signal level to
the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3D.1.5-1.
7.	SS shall send SL Discovery Packets (MAC padding bits) on the SL RMC for the test time [FFS]. SS stores the
number of the transmitted Discovery Packets in the current test iteration in the variable Ptot.
8.	SS shall send (on the available PDSCH) a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT
DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER REQUEST" message and wait for the UE to respond (on the available
PUSCH) with a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER
RESPONSE".
9.	SS calculates the variable Pok as (current counter value - counter value at last test iteration).
10.	SS shall compute the throughput as following:
	TP = Pok / Ptot * 100%

7.3EA.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions and test frequencies based on the subset of E-UTRA
operating bands defined for CAT M1 in clause 5.2E. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.3EA.4.1-1. The details of the downlink and uplink
reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The details of the OCNG patterns used
are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and MPDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 2:	The Narrowband index (TS36.211, 5.2.4) shall be set to 0 for all testpoints.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.3 using only main
UE Tx/Rx antenna.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.3EA.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-CE according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2AA. Message contents are defined
in clause 7.3EA.4.3.
7.3EA.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via M-PDCCH DCI format 6-1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3EA.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The SS sends one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.3EA.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send,
the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the Downlink signal level to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in Table 7.3EA.5-1 for FDD and TDD
and in Table 7.3EA.5-2 for HD-FDD. Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink
scheduling information to the UE to ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement.
4.	Measure the average throughput for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.

7.4.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level tests the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified reference
measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
7.4.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port, at which the specified
relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.4.3-1. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in

7.4A	Maximum input level for CA
7.4A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the maximum input level is defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the band whose
downlink is being tested. For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without uplink band or an
operating band with an unpaired DL part, the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier
active in each band capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.4.3 for each
component carrier while all downlink carriers are active.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation maximum input level is defined as the powers received at the UE antenna
port over the Transmission bandwidth configuration of each CC, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet or
exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel over each component carrier.
The downlink SCC shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. For FDD the PCC shall be configured
closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the test. The uplink output power shall be set
as specified in Table 7.4A.0-1 with the uplink configuration set according to Table 7.3A.0-1 for the applicable carrier
aggregation configuration. For UE(s) supporting one uplink carrier, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in
accordance with Table 7.3.3-2.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels over each
component carrier as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.4A.0-1. For operating bands
with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements also apply for an SCC assigned in the unpaired
part with parameters specified in Table 7.4A.0-1.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, each larger
than or equal to 5 MHz, the maximum input level requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance
with Table 7.3A.0-3. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified
in Table 7.4.3-1 and Table 7.4A.0-1 for one component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively.
The throughput of each downlink component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the specified
reference measurement channel as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern
OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). The requirements apply with all downlink carriers active.

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguous sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and one uplink assigned to
one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in a band other than that supporting the
downlink(s) under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is active
in the band supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than the
downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component
carriers. For these uplink configurations, the UE shall meet the maximum input-level requirements for intra-band non-
contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink sub-blocks, the requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation for the contiguously aggregated downlink carriers and for any remaining component carrier(s) the
requirements specified in subclause 7.4.3. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the
requirements for the downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation.
The normative references for this requirement are TS 36.101 [2] clauses 7.4.1A and 7.4.1.
7.4A.1	Maximum input level for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA)
Editor's note:
- Any restriction of the applicability of test points due to the supported UE category is under investigation
7.4A.1.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4A.1.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA.
7.4A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.4A.0.
7.4A.1.4	Test description
7.4A.1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink
reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG
patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.80 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4A.1.4.3.
7.4A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.4A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.4A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload data
to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value defined in Table 7.4A.1.5-1. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement:
The PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1 + 10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)),
for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1 + 10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
The SCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1 + 10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)),
for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1 + 10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3.3-2 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.
Note 4:	For CA_70C all test frequency IDs shall be tested according to table 4.3.1.1.70A-1, in TS 36.508 [7].

7.4A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.4A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.4A.2.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value defined in Table 7.4A.1.5-1. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power
is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0
dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput
measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.4A.2.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.4.4.3.
7.4A.2.5	Test requirement
Same test requirements as in clause 7.4A.1.5 with the following exceptions:

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.3.5-
2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but confined within the
transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration, according to the UE
declared capability for UL support (within CA operation) in the individual bands.

7.4A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.4A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.4A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.4A.3.5-1. Send Uplink power control commands
to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4
dB of the target level in Table 7.4A.3.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target
level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7. 	Measure the average throughput of SCC for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
7.4A.3.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.4.4.3.
7.4A.3.5	Test requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the maximum input level is defined with
the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested, i.e. the requirements are tested only
for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement for each component carrier, when operated as SCell, while
both downlink carriers are active.
The throughput measured during the test procedure for each component carrier, when operated as SCell, shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters
specified in Table 7.4A.3.5-1 (originated from the single carrier Table 7.4.5-1).

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration, which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table
5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL
operating band.
Note 3:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA
Configuration
Note 4:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA
Configuration

7.4A.4_H.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.4A.4_H.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer 3GPP TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer 3GPP TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1 for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.4A.4_H.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.4A.4_H.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send,
the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value defined in Table 7.4A.4_H.5-1. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement:
The PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.4_H.5-1), for carrier frequency f
≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.4A.4_H.5-1) for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
7.4A.4_H.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as defined in clause 7.4.4.3.
7.4A.4_H.5	Test requirement
The throughput measurement of each carrier derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters specified in Table 7.4A.4_H.5-1
(originated from the single carrier Table 7.4.5-1).

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to 4dB below PCMAX_L at the minimum uplink configuration
specified in Table 7.3.1-2 with PCMAX_L as defined in subclause 6.2.5.
Note 2:	Reference measurement channel is Annex A.3.2: 256QAM, R=4/5 variant with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.

7.4A.5	Maximum input level for 3DL CA
7.4A.5.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4A.5.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band contiguous
CA or 3DL with Inter-band CA or 3DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA or 3DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 3DL with FDD-TDD CA.
7.4A.5.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The Minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.4A.0.
7.4A.5.4	Test description
7.4A.5.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in tables of 5.4.2A.1 as applicable. All of these configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 7.4A.5.4.1-1 to 7.4A.5.4.1-2. The details
of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3
respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.4A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.4A.5.4.1-1 to 7.4A.5.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.4A.5.4.1-1 to 7.4A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined in Table 7.4A.5.5-2 or 7.4A.5.5-3
according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size
should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.4A.5.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
8.	Repeat steps 6 to 7 for all component carriers indicated in Table 7.4A.5.4.2-1.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.55 if the UE
supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.80 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to clauses C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to clauses H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 7.4A.5_H.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to clause B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4A.5_H.4.3.
7.4A.5_H.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to clauses C.0, C.1 and clause C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4A.5_H.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1 for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.4A.5_H.4.1-1 to 7.4A.5_H.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits
on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.4A.5_H.4.1-1 to 7.4A.5_H.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC. Since the
UE has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined in Table 7.4A.5_H.5-1 or 7.4A.5_H.5-2
according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size
should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4dB) of the target level for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz	or within (+0dB, -4dB) of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to clause G.2A.
8.	Repeat steps 6 to 7 for all component carriers indicated in Table 7.4A.5_H.4.2-1.

7.4A.7	Maximum input level for 4DL CA
7.4A.7.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4A.7.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 4DL with Inter-band CA, or 4DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA or 4DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 4DL with
Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 4DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.
7.4A.7.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The Minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.4A.0.
7.4A.7.4	Test description
7.4A.7.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in tables of 5.4.2A.1 as applicable. All of these configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 7.4A.7.4.1-1 to 7.4A.7.4.1-2. The details
of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3
respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band contiguous & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test
Settings test points.
Note 3:	Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table.
Otherwise use the Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	Inter-band & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA
Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41E, X=41.
Note 6:	Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-7A-8A,X=1,Y=3,Z=7,R=8.
Note 7:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_3C-7A-28A, X=3,Y=7 and Z=28.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose for testing the Combination with maximum
NRB_PCC and then select maximum NRB_SCC1 for the chosen NRB_PCC.
Note 10:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with NRB_PCC
= NRB_SCC1 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_PCC for testing.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table.
Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band
as PCC are not applicable.
Note 4:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A,X=2,Y=4,Z=12.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-41A-41A,X=41.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-
4A,X=2,Y=4.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose
the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.




1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.55.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 7.4A.7.4.1-1 to 7.4A.7.4.1-2.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4A.7.4.3.
7.4A.7.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.4A.7.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.4A.7.4.1-1 to 7.4A.7.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.4A.7.4.1-1 to 7.4A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined in Table 7.4A.7.5-2 or 7.4A.7.5-3
according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size
should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.4A.7.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
8.	Repeat steps 6 to 7 for all component carriers indicated in Table 7.4A.7.4.2-1.

7.4A.8.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4A.8.2	Test applicability
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 5DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous CA or 5DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Inter-band CA or 5DL with Intra-band contiguous and
Inter-band CA or 5DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 5DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA, or 5DL with Intra-band contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA..
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 5DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 5DL with Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 5DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support 5DL CA involving Band 46.

Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with
NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.55.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 7.4A.8.4.1-1 to 7.4A.8.4.1-2.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4A.8.4.3.
7.4A.8.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.4A.8.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.4A.8.4.1-1 to 7.4A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.4A.8.4.1-1 to 7.4A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined in Table 7.4A.8.5-1 or 7.4A.8.5-2
according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size
should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
7.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.4A.8.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
8.	Repeat steps 6 to 7 for all component carriers indicated in Table 7.4A.8.4.2-1.

7.4B	Maximum input level for UL-MIMO
7.4B.1	Test purpose
Maximum input level tests the ability of UE that support UL- MIMO to receive data with a given average throughput
for a specified reference measurement channel, under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added
noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area near to an e-
NodeB.
7.4B.2	Test applicability

7.5	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
7.5.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity tests the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified
reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
7.5.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to receive an E-UTRA signal at its assigned
channel frequency in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of
the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive
filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5.3-1 for all values of an adjacent channel interferer
up to ?25 dBm. However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range of test
parameters are chosen in Table 7.5.3-2 and Table 7.5.3-3 where the throughput Rav shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). For operating bands
with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired part.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, which
applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on E-UTRA band, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according
to table 7.3.3-2 is tested per Test Channel Bandwidth. The allocation shall be located as
close as possible to the downlink operating band but confined within the transmission
bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 3:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.
Note 4:	Applicable only to E-UTRA FDD Band 31. The UL resource blocks shall be located at
RBstart 10 (according to Table 7.3.3-2).

1.	Connect the SS and interfering source to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Figure A.4.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.5.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.5.4.3.
7.5.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.5.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.5.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5.5-2 (Case 1). Send Uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
+0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.5.5-2 (Case 1) for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB
of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput
measurement.
4.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5.5-2 (Case 1) and frequency below the wanted
signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 4.
7.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5.5-3 (Case 2). Send Uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
+0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.5.5-3 (Case 2) for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB
of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput
measurement.
8.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5.5-3 (Case 2) and frequency below the wanted
signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
9.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
10.	Repeat steps from 7 to 9, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 2 at step 8.
11.	Repeat for applicable channel bandwidths and operating band combinations in both Case 1 and Case 2.

7.5A	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for CA
7.5A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band, the adjacent channel requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the band
whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.5.3 for each component
carrier while all downlink carriers are active. For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without
uplink operation or an operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all
downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. For a component
carrier configured in Band 46, the requirements specified in subclause 7.5.3 are replaced by the requirements in Table
7.5A.0-1a with test parameters in Table 7.5A.0-2a and Table 7.5A.0-3a.

NOTE 1:	In a band capable of uplink operation, the transmitter shall be set to 24dB below PCMAX_L at the minimum uplink
configuration specified in Table 7.3.1-2 with PCMAX_L as defined in subclause 6.2.5.
NOTE 2:	The interferer consists of the Reference measurement channel specified in Annex A.3.2 with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 and set-up according to Annex C.3.1.

For E-UTRA CA configurations listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a under conditions for which reference sensitivity for the
operating band being tested is N/A, the adjacent channel requirements of subclause 7.5A.0 do not apply.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to
the PCC. For FDD, the PCC shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers shall be active
throughout the test. The uplink output power shall be set as specified in Table 7.5A.0-2 or Table 7.5A.0-3 with the
uplink configuration set according to Table 7.3A.0-1 for the applicable carrier aggregation configuration. For UE(s)
supporting one uplink carrier, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2. The UE
shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5A.0-1 for an adjacent channel interferer on either side of the
aggregated downlink signal at a specified frequency offset and for an interferer power up to -25 dBm. The throughput
of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.5A.0-2 and 7.5A.0-3. For operating bands
with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements also apply for an SCC assigned in the unpaired
part with parameters specified in Tables 7.5A.0-2 and 7.5A.0-3.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, each larger
than or equal to 5 MHz, the adjacent channel selectivity requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in
accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block
as specified in subclauses 7.5.3 and 7.5A.0 for one component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block,
respectively. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirements all values of a single adjacent channel interferer in-gap and
out-of-gap up to a ?25 dBm interferer power while all downlink carriers are active. For the lower range of test
parameters (Case 1), the interferer power Pinterferer shall be set to the maximum of the levels given by the carriers of the
respective sub-blocks as specified in Table 7.5.3-2 and Table 7.5A.0-2 for one component carrier and two component
carriers per sub-block, respectively. The wanted signal power levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall then be
adjusted relative to Pinterferer in accordance with the ACS requirement for each sub-block (Table 7.5.3-1 and Table
7.5A.0-1). For the upper range of test parameters (Case 2) for which the interferer power Pinterferer is -25 dBm (Table
7.5.3-3 and Table 7.5A.0-3) the wanted signal power levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall be adjusted relative
to Pinterferer like for Case 1.

NOTE 3:	The Finterferer (offset) is the frequency separation of the centre frequency of the carrier closest to the
interferer and the centre frequency of the adjacent channel interferer and shall be further adjusted to
 MHz to be offset from the sub-carrier raster.

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to four non-
contiguously aggregated carriers per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and one uplink
carrier assigned to one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in each band other than that
supporting the downlink(s) under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the
uplink is active in the band supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is
active in a band supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is
active in a band supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating
band than the downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four
component carriers. For these uplink configurations, the UE shall meet the adjacent channel selectivity requirements for
intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink sub-blocks with ?RIBNC = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps
(Table 7.3A.0-3) for the two non-contiguous downlink sub-blocks, the requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation for the contiguously aggregated downlink carriers and for any remaining component carrier(s) the
requirements specified in subclause 7.5.3. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the
requirements for downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation.
The normative references for this requirement are TS 36.101 [2] clauses 7.5.1A and 7.5.1.
7.5A.1	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for CA (intra-band contiguous
DL CA and UL CA)
7.5A.1.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5A.1.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA.
7.5A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.5A.0.
7.5A.1.4	Test description
7.5A.1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.5A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink
reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG
patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3.3-2
for UE supporting one uplink carrier and to table 7.3A.0-1 for UE supporting two uplink carriers are tested per
Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.

1.	Connect the SS and interfering source to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure
group A.34 as appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in
the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.5A.1.4.1-1.
5,	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.5A.1.4.3.
7.5A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.5A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.5A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
 6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1). Send
Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at
least the duration of the Throughput measurement:
The PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) +
10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) + 10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
The SCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) +
10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) + 10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
7.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) and frequency below the
wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document. The
interferer frequencies are adjusted in analogy with table 7.5A.1.4.2-1.
8.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 7.
10.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2). Send
Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at
least the duration of the Throughput measurement:
The PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2) +
10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2) + 10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
The SCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2) +
10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2) + 10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.1.5-3 (Case 2) and frequency below the
wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document. The
interferer frequencies are adjusted in analogy with table 7.5A.1.4.2-1.
12.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
13.	Repeat steps from 10 to 12, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 2 at step 11.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3.3-2
for UE supporting one uplink carrier.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.
Note 4:	For CA_70C all test frequency IDs shall be tested according to table 4.3.1.1.70A-1, in TS 36.508 [7].

7.5A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.3.5-
2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but confined within the
transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration, according to the UE
declared capability for UL support (within CA operation) in the individual bands.

7.5A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.5A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
 6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.3.5-2 (Case 1), or
7.5A.3.5-2a for operating band 46. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step
size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table
7.5A.3.5-2 (Case 1) for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.3.5-2 (Case 1), or 7.5A.3.5-2a for operating
band 46, and frequency below the wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D
of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput of SCC for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 7.
10.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.3.5-3 (Case 2), or
7.5A.3.5-3a for operating band 46. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step
size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table
7.5A.3.5-3 (Case 2) for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.3.5-3 (Case 2), or 7.5A.3.5-3a for operating
band 46, and frequency below the wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D
of the present document.
12.	Measure the average throughput of SCC for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
13.	Repeat steps from 10 to 12, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 2 at step 11.
7.5A.3.4.3	Message contents
The message contents are the same as in clause 7.5.4.3.
7.5A.3.5	Test Requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band, the adjacent channel requirements are
defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested i.e. the requirements are
tested only for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement specified in Table 7.5A.3.5-1 (originated from
the single carrier Table 7.5.3.5-1), or the requirement specified in Table 7.5A.3.5-1a for operating band 46, with the test
parameters specified in Tables 7.5A.3.5-2 and 7.5A.3.5-3 (originated from the single carrier Tables 7.5.5-2 and 7.5.5-3),
or with the test parameters specified in Tables 7.5A.3.5-2a and 7.5A.3.5-3a for operating band 46, for each component
carrier, when operated as SCell, while both downlink carriers are active.
The test requirements do not apply when the interfering signal overlaps with the channel bandwidth of any downlink
CC.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration, which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table
5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL
operating band.
Note 3:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA
Configuration
Note 4:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA
Configuration

7.5A.4.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.5A.4.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.4.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.5A.4.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.4.5-2 (Case 1). Send
Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE
output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.5A.1.5-2 (Case 1) for carrier frequency f ≤
3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.4.5-2 (Case 1) and frequency below the
wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 7.
10.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.4.5-3 (Case 2). Send
Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE
output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.5A.4.5-3 (Case 2) for carrier frequency f ≤
3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5A.4.5-3 (Case 2) and frequency below the
wanted signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
12.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
13.	Repeat steps from 10 to 12, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 2 at step 11.
7.5A.4.4.3	Message contents
The message contents are the same as in clause 7.5.4.3.
7.5A.4.5	Test requirement
The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A.3.2 under the conditions specified in table 7.5A.4.5-2, and also under the conditions specified in
table 7.5A.4.5-3.

7.5A.5	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for 3DL CA
7.5A.5.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5A.5.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band contiguous
CA or 3DL with Inter-band CA or 3DL with Intra-band contiguous Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 3DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA, or 3DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 3DL with FDD-TDD CA.
7.5A.5.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The Minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.5A.0.
7.5A.5.4	Test description
7.5A.5.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in tables of 5.4.2A.1 as applicable. All of these configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in tables 7.5A.5.4.1-1 to 7.5A.5.4.1-2. The details
of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3
respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.5A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer to TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.5.4.1-1 to 7.5A.5.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.5A.5.4.1-1 to 7.5A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined for Case 1 in Table 7.5A.5.5-2 or
7.5A.5.5-5, according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHzor within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value defined for Case 1 in Table 7.5A.5.5-2 or 7.5A.5.5-5, according to the
type of CA, with frequency below the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.5.4.2-1, using a modulated
interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document. The interferer frequencies are adjusted in
analogy with table 7.5A.1.4.2-1.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.5A.5.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.5.4.2-
1.
10.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined for Case 2 in Table 7.5A.5.5-3 or
7.5A.5.5-6, according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value defined for Case 2 in Table 7.5A.5.5-3 or 7.5A.5.5-6, according to the
type of CA, with frequency below the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.5.4.2-1, using a modulated
interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document. The interferer frequencies are adjusted in
analogy with table 7.5A.1.4.2-1.
12.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.5A.5.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
13.	Repeat steps from 10 to 12, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table
7.5A.5.4.2-1.
14.	Repeat steps 6 to 13 for component carriers listed in Table 7.5A.5.4.2-1.

7.5A.6
7.5A.7	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for 4DL CA
7.5A.7.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5A.7.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 4DL with Inter-band CA, or 4DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 4DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous CA and Inter-band CA, or 4DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 4DL with
Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 4DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.
7.5A.7.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The Minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.5A.0.
7.5A.7.4	Test description
7.5A.7.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in tables of 5.4.2A.1 as applicable. All of these configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in tables 7.5A.7.4.1-1 to 7.5A.7.4.1-2. The details
of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3
respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.58.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 7.5A.7.4.1-1 to 7.5A.7.4.1-2.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.5A.7.4.3.
7.5A.7.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.5A.7.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer to TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.7.4.1-1 to 7.5A.7.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 7.5A.7.4.1-1 to 7.5A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined for Case 1 in Table 7.5A.7.5-2 or
7.5A.7.5-5, according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHzor within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value defined for Case 1 in Table 7.5A.7.5-2 or 7.5A.7.5-5, according to the
type of CA, with frequency below the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.7.4.2-1, using a modulated
interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.5A.7.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.7.4.2-
1.
10.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCCs to the value defined for Case 2 in Table 7.5A.7.5-3 or
7.5A.7.5-6, according to the type of CA. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value defined for Case 2 in Table 7.5A.7.5-3 or 7.5A.7.5-6, according to the
type of CA, with frequency below the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.7.4.2-1, using a modulated
interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
12.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.5A.7.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
13.	Repeat steps from 10 to 12, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table
7.5A.7.4.2-1.
14.	Repeat steps 6 to 13 for component carriers listed in Table 7.5A.7.4.2-1.

7.5A.8	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for 5DL CA
Editor’s Note: This test case is incomplete. The following items are missing or are incomplete:
- The test applicability needs to be added to TS 36.521-2
- Test configuration table for some CA configurations is under discussion
7.5A.8.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity for CA test verifies the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5A.8.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 5DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 5DL with Inter-band CA, or 4DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 5DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous CA or 5DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Inter-band CA or 5DL with Intra-band contiguous and
Inter-band CA or 5DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 5DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA, or 5DL with Intra-band contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 5DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.58 if the UE
supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 7.5A.8.4.1-1 to 7.5A.8.4.1-2.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.5A.8.4.3.
7.5A.8.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.5A.8.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8). Wait
for at least 2 seconds (Refer to TS 36.133 [4], clause 8.3.3.2).
4. 	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables
7.5A.8.4.1-1 to 7.5A.8.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the

step size should be used), to ensure that the PCC output power is within +0dB, -3.4 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within +0dB, -4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of
the Throughput measurement.
11.	Set the Interferer signal level to the value defined for Case 2 in Table 7.5A.8.5-3 or 7.5A.8.5-6, according to the
type of CA, with frequency below the measured carrier(s) according to table 7.5A.8.4.2-1, using a modulated
interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
12.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.5A.8.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.

7.5B	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for UL-MIMO
7.5B.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity tests the ability of UE that support UL-MIMO to receive data with a given average
throughput for a specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given
frequency offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added
noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5B.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
7.5B.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the minimum
requirements in Clause 7.5.3 shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2. For UL-
MIMO, the parameter PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.5.1B.
7.5B.4	Test description
7.5B.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.5B.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex

7.5EA	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for UE category M1
7.5EA.1	Test purpose
 Adjacent channel selectivity tests the ability of category M1 UE to receive data with a given average throughput for a
specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5EA.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of category M1.
7.5EA.3	Minimum conformance requirements
 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to receive an E-UTRA signal at its assigned
channel frequency in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of
the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive
filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5EA.3-1 for all values of an adjacent channel
interferer up to ?25 dBm. However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range of
test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5EA.3-2 and Table 7.5EA.3-3 where the throughput Rav shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). For operating
bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired
part.

7.5F	Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) for category NB1
7.5F.1	Test purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity tests the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified
reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5F.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of UE release 13 and forward of category NB1 UE.
7.5F.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to receive a signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of the
assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
Category NB1 UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5F.3-1 for all values of an adjacent
channel interferer up to ?25 dBm. However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper
range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5F.3-1 where the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex A.3.2.

concurrent with E-UTRA uplink transmissions
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	Test configuration table is investigating.
-	Connection diagram is TBD
-	UE test mode is FFS
7.5G.1.1	Test Purpose
Adjacent channel selectivity tests the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified
reference measurement channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when other e-
NodeB transmitters exist in the adjacent channel.
7.5G.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X Communication.
7.5G.1.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The V2X UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5G.1.3-1 for all values of an adjacent channel
interferer up to -25 dBm. However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range of
test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5G.1.3-2 and Table 7.5G.1.3-3 where the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.8.2.

7.6	Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver's ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response or the
adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a
specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a spurious response
occur.
7.6.1	In-band blocking
7.6.1.1	Test Purpose
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below to 15MHz
above the UE receive band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except in
the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
7.6.1.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.1.3-1 and 7.6.1.3-2. For operating bands
with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired part.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, which
applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on E-UTRA band, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according
to table 7.3.3-2 is tested per Test Channel Bandwidth. The allocation shall be located as
close as possible to the downlink operating band but confined within the transmission
bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 3:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.
Note 4:	Applicable only to E-UTRA FDD Band 31. The UL resource blocks shall be located at
RBstart 10 (according to Table 7.3.3-2).

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, in Figure A.4.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to in Table 7.6.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1.4.3.
7.6.1.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the wanted signal in Case 1 according
to Tables 7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1.5-2.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE
(less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the
target level in table 7.6.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 3.
7.	Repeat steps from 3 to 6, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 3and 6. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1.4.2-1.

7.6.1A	In-band blocking for CA
7.6.1A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the in-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the band
whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.6.1 for each component
carrier while all downlink carriers are active. For the UE which supports inter band CA configuration in Table 7.3.3-1A,
PInterferer power defined in Table 7.6.1.3-2 is increased by the amount given by ΔRIB,c in Table 7.3.3-1A. For E-UTRA
CA configurations including an operating band without uplink operation or an operating band with an unpaired DL part
(as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each
band capable of UL operation. The requirements for the component carrier configured in the operating band without
uplink operation are specified in Table 7.6.1A.0-0, Table 7.6.1A.0-0a and Table 7.6.1A.0-0b.

For E-UTRA CA configurations listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a under conditions for which reference sensitivity for the
operating band being tested is N/A, the in-band blocking requirements of subclause 7.6.1A.0 do not apply.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to
the PCC. For FDD, the PCC shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers shall be active
throughout the test. The uplink output power shall be set as specified in Table 7.6.1A.0-1 with the uplink configuration
set according to Table 7.3A.0-1 for the applicable carrier aggregation configuration. For UE(s) supporting one uplink
carrier, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2. The UE shall fulfil the minimum
requirement in presence of an interfering signal specified in Tables 7.6.1A.0-1 and Tables 7.6.1A.0-2 being on either
side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables
7.6.1A.0-1 and 7.6.1A.0-2. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements
also apply for an SCC assigned in the unpaired part with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.1A.0-1 and 7.6.1A.0-2.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, each larger
than or equal to 5 MHz, the in-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance with
Table 7.3A.0-3. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in
subclause 7.6.1.3 and in this subclause for single component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block,
respectively. The requirements apply for in-gap and out-of-gap interferers while all downlink carriers are active..

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguously sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and one uplink carrier
assigned to one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in the band other than that supporting
the downlink(s) under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is
active in the band supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is active in a
band supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is active in a
band supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than
the downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component
carriers. For these uplink configurations, the UE shall meet the in-band blocking requirements for intra-band non-
contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink sub-blocks with ?RIBNC = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table 7.3A.0-3)
for the two non-contiguous downlink sub-blocks, the requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for the
contiguously aggregated downlink carriers and for any remaining component carrier(s) the requirements specified in
subclause 7.6.1.3. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the requirements for the downlinks shall
be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of uplink operation.
For contiguously aggregated component carriers configured in Band 46, the said requirements for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation of downlink carriers are replaced by requirements in Table 7.6.1A.0-3 and 7.6.1A.0-4.

In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below to 15MHz
above the UE receive band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels. The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB
transmitters exist (except in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1A.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA.

7.6.1A.1.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 7.6.1A.1.4.1-1. The details of the OCNG patterns used

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.34 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are for PCC initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.1A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1A.1.4.3.
7.6.1A.1.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.1A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers in
Case 1 according to Tables 7.6.1A.1.5-1 and 7.6.1A.1.5-2.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1A.1.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at least the duration of the throughput
measurement:
The PCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.6.1A.1.5-1 +
10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.6.1A.1.5-1 + 10log(P_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
The SCC output power is within (+0dB, -3.4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.6.1A.1.5-1 +
10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)), for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz,
or within (+0dB, -4 dB) of (target level in Table 7.6.1A.1.5-1 + 10log(S_LCRB/NRB_alloc)) for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
8.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the aggregated component carriers in Case 1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 6 and 9. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1A.1.4.2-1.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3.3-2 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.
Note 4:	For CA_70C all test frequency IDs shall be tested according to table 4.3.1.1.70A-1, in TS 36.508 [7].

7.6.1A.2.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.2.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers in
Case 1 according to Tables 7.6.1A.1.5-1 and 7.6.1A.1.5-2.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1A.1.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.1A.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the aggregated component carriers in Case 1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 6 and 9. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1A.1.4.2-1.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.3.5-
2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but confined within the
transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration, according to the UE
declared capability for UL support (within CA operation) in the individual bands.

7.6.1A.3.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.2 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the SCC in Case 1 according to Tables
7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1.5-2, or 7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1A.3.5-0 for operating bands without uplink band (as noted in Table
5.2-1) , or 7.6.1A.3.5-0a and 7.6.1A.3.5-0b for operating band 46 without uplink band.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1A.3.5-1 or table 7.6.1A.3.5-0a for operating band 46.
Send uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that
the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table 7.6.1A.3.5-1 or table 7.6.1A.3.5-0a for
operating band 46 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput of SCC for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the SCC in Case 1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 6 and 9. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1.4.2-1.
7.6.1A.3.4.3	Message Contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.6.1.4.3.
7.6.1A.3.5	Test Requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the in-band blocking requirements are
defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested i.e. the requirements are
tested only for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement for each component carrier, when operated as
SCell, while both downlink carriers are active.
For band combinations including an operating band without uplink band (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for
both downlinks shall be met with the uplink in the band capable of UL operation.
The throughput measured during the test procedure for each component carrier, when operated as SCell, shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters
specified in Tables 7.6.1A.3.5-1 and 7.6.1A.3.5-2 (originated from the single carrier Tables 7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1.5-2) and
also Table 7.6.1A.3.5-0 for band combinations including an operating band without uplink operation or Table
7.6.1A.3.5-0a and Table 7.6.1A.3.5-0b for band combinations including operating band 46 without uplink operation.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration, which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table
5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The carrier centre frequency of PCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL
operating band.
Note 3:	Applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA
Configuration
Note 4:	Not applicable if only Bandwidth Combination Set 0 is supported by the UE for the CA

7.6.1A.4.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.2 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.1A.4.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.4.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the PCC in Case 1 according to Tables
7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1.5-2, excluding frequencies where the interferer centre frequency falls within SCC carrier
±(BW/2 + FIoffset,case 1), where BW & offset refer to SCC.
7.	Set the downlink signal level for PCC and SCC according to the table 7.6.1.5-1. Send uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
+0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table 7.6.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the
target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput of the PCC for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the PCC in Case 1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using an interfering signal below and above the SCC in Case 1 and measuring SCC
instead of PCC in step 8, excluding the frequencies where the interferer centre frequency falls within PCC carrier
±(BW/2 + FIoffset,case 1), where BW & offset refer to PCC.
11.	Repeat steps from 6 to 10, replacing references to Case 1 with references to Case 2. The ranges of case 2 are
covered in steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1.4.2-1.
7.6.1A.4.4.3	Message Contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.6.1.4.3.
7.6.1A.4.5	Test Requirement
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink carriers, each larger than or
equal to 5 MHz, the in-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration of the PCC being in
accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in tables 7.6.1A.4.5-1 and 7.6.1A.4.5-2
for each component carrier while both downlink carriers are active. The requirements for each component carrier are the
same as single carrier requirements in Tables 7.6.1.5-1 and 7.6.1.5-2.
The throughput measurement derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.1A.4.5-1 and 7.6.1A.4.5-2.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.58 as appropriate if
the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.1A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1A.5.4.3.
7.6.1A.5.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.1A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.5.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.5.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers in
Case 1 according to Table 7.6.1A.5.4.2-1.
7	Set the downlink signal level according to the Table 7.6.1A.5.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.1A.5.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in Table 7.6.1A.5.4.2-1for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to Table
7.6.1A.5.5-1 in Case 1 at step 6.
10	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 6 and 9. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1A.1.4.2-1.
11.	Repeat steps 1 to 10 for all component carriers listed in Table 7.6.1A.5.4.2-1.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table.
Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band
as PCC are not applicable.
Note 4:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A,X=2,Y=4,Z=12.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-41A-41A,X=41.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-
4A,X=2,Y=4.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose
the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.




1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.58 as appropriate if
the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.1A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1A.7.4.3.
7.6.1A.7.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.1A.7.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.7.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.7.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers in
Case 1 according to Table 7.6.1A.7.4.2-1.
7	Set the downlink signal level according to the Table 7.6.1A.7.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.1A.7.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in Table 7.6.1A.7.4.2-1for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to Table
7.6.1A.7.5-1 in Case 1 at step 6.
10	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 6 and 9. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1A.1.4.2-1.
11.	Repeat steps 1 to 10 for all component carriers listed in Table 7.6.1A.7.4.2-1.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.58 as appropriate if
the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.1A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1A.8.4.3.
7.6.1A.8.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.1A.8.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.8.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.1A.8.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers in
Case 1 according to Table 7.6.1A.8.4.2-1.
7	Set the downlink signal level according to the Table 7.6.1A.8.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.1A.8.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.

For a UE, which supports CA configuration in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and
7.3.3-1C, PInterferer power defined in Tables 7.6.1A.8.5-1, 7.6.1A.8.5-3
and 7.6.1A.8.5-5 is increased by the amount given by ΔRIB,c in
Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B and 7.3.3-1C accordingly.7.6.1B	In-band
blocking for UL-MIMO
7.6.1B.1	Test Purpose
In-band blocking for UL- MIMO is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below
to 15MHz above the UE that support UL-MIMO receive band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the
requirement for the specified measurement channels.
The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except in
the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1B.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
7.6.1B.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements
in subclause 7.6 shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2. For UL-MIMO, the
parameter PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.6B.
7.6.1B.4	Test Description
7.6.1B.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.6.1B.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex
C.2.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, which
applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on E-UTRA band, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according
to table 7.3.3-2 is tested per Test Channel Bandwidth.
Note 3:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.
Note 4:	Applicable only to E-UTRA FDD Band 31. The UL resource blocks shall be located at
RBstart 10 (according to Table 7.3.3-2).

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, in Figure A.29.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to in Table 7.6.1B.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.1B.4.3.
7.6.1B.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1B.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1B.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the wanted signal in Case 1 according
to Tables 7.6.1B.5-1 and 7.6.1B.5-2.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1B.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE
(less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the
target level in table 7.6.1B.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 3.
7.	Repeat steps from 3 to 6, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 3and 6. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1B.4.2-1.
8.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using successively all interfering signals in Case 3 and Case 4 at step 3.

7.6.1D.1	In-band blocking for ProSe Direct Discovery
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	ProSe UE authentication is not handled in the test case and is still under investigation.
-	Use of OCNG for Downlink has not been considered and is still FFS.
-	Message exceptions content needs further investigation (some values still TBD).
-	Test time is FFS.
7.6.1D.1.1	Test Purpose
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below to 15MHz
above the ProSe band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other Sidelink transmitters exist (except in
the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1D.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward which support ProSe Direct Discovery, but not
ProSe Direct Communication.

number of the transmitted Discovery Packets in the current test iteration in the variable Ptot.
10.	SS shall send (on the available PDSCH) a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT
DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER REQUEST" message and wait for the UE to respond (on the available
PUSCH) with a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER
RESPONSE".
11.	SS calculates the variable Pok as (current counter value - counter value at last test iteration).
12.	SS shall compute the throughput as following:
TP = Pok / Ptot * 100%
13.	Repeat steps from 6 to 12, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 7.

7.6.1G.1	In-band blocking for V2X Communication / Non-concurrent with E-
UTRA uplink transmissions
7.6.1G.1.1	Test Purpose
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below to 15MHz
above the V2X band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other Sidelink transmitters exist (except in
the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1G.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X Communication.
7.6.1G.1.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The V2X UE throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A.8.2 with parameters defined in Table 7.6.1G.1.3-1 and Table 7.6.1G.1.3-2.

7.6.1EA	In-band blocking for UE category M1
7.6.1EA.1	Test Purpose
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the range from 15MHz below to 15MHz
above the category M1 UE receive band, at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the
specified measurement channels.
The lack of in-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except in
the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.1EA.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
7.6.1EA.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.1EA.3-1 and 7.6.1EA.3-2. For operating
bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired
part.

2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.1EA.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-CE according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2AA. Message contents are defined
in clause 7.6.1EA.4.3.
7.6.1EA.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via MPDCCH DCI format 6-1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1EA.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The SS sends one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.1EA.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send,
the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the wanted signal in Case 1 according
to Tables 7.6.1EA.5-1 and 7.6.1EA.5-2.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.1EA.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.1EA.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	Measure the average throughput for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal in Case 1 at step 3.
7.	Repeat steps from 3 to 6, using interfering signals in Case 2 at step 3 and 6. The ranges of case 2 are covered in
steps equal to the interferer bandwidth. The test frequencies are chosen in analogy to table 7.6.1EA.4.2-1.

7.6.2	Out-of-band blocking
7.6.2.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or above
the UE receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel
selectivity in sub-clause 7.5.1 and sub-clause 7.6.1 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.2.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
7.6.2.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.2.3-1 and 7.6.2.3-2. For operating bands
with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired part.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to  exceptions are allowed for spurious
response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where   is the
number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.4.2-1). For these
exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7 Spurious Response are applicable.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 4, up to  exceptions are allowed for spurious
response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where   is the
number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configurations (see Figure 5.4.2-1) and   is the
number of resource blocks allocated in the uplink. For these exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7 Spurious
Response are applicable.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, which
applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on E-UTRA band, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according
to table 7.3.3-2 is tested per Test Channel Bandwidth. The allocation shall be located as
close as possible to the downlink operating band but confined within the transmission
bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 3:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.
Note 4:	Applicable only to E-UTRA FDD Band 31. The UL resource blocks shall be located at
RBstart 10 (according to Table 7.3.3-2).

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, in Figure A.5.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

7.6.2.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the wanted signal according to
Table 7.6.2.5-2. The frequency step size is 1MHz.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.2.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE
(less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the
target level in table 7.6.2.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.

7.6.2A	Out-of-band blocking for CA
7.6.2A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band, the out-of-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the
band whose downlink is being tested. The throughput in the downlink measured shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Tables 7.6.2.3-1 and 7.6.2A.0-0. For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without
uplink operation (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the uplink active in the
band(s) capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet these requirements for each component carrier while all downlink
carriers are active.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink active in two E-UTRA
bands, the out-of-band blocking requirements specified above shall be met with the transmitter power for the uplink set
to 7 dB below PCMAX_L,c for each serving cell c.
For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without uplink band or an operating band with an unpaired
DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in
each band capable of UL operation. For E-UTRA CA configurations listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a under conditions for
which reference sensitivity for the operating band being tested is N/A, the out-of-band blocking requirements of
subclause 7.6.2A.0 do not apply.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, the out-of-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance with table 7.3A.0-3. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in subclauses 7.6.2.3 and 7.6.2A.0 for
one component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply with all
downlink carriers active.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA channel
per sub-block of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies when measured using a
1MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements of subclause 7.7A.4.3 spurious response are applicable.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 4, up to  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA channel
per sub-block of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies when measured using a
1MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7A.4.3 spurious response are applicable.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two uplink carriers and two downlink carriers, the out-of-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration of the PCC and SCC being in accordance with Table
7.3A.0-4 and powers of both carriers set to PCMAX_L,c ? 7 dBm. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in
subclause 7.6.2A.0 for each component carrier while both downlink carriers are active.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to 2?  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA
channel per sub-block of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies for two active
uplinks in the same operating band when measured using a 1MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements of
subclause 7.7 spurious response are applicable.
For Table 7.6.2.3-2 in frequency range 4, up to 2?  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA
channel per sub-block of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies for two active
uplinks in the same operating band when measured using a 1MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements of
clause 7.7 spurious response are applicable.
For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguously sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and the uplink assigned to
one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active a band other than that supporting the downlink(s)
under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is active in the band
supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is active in a band supporting two
contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is active in a band supporting one
carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than the downlink SCC(s)
when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component carriers. For the two
non-contiguous component carriers within the same band, Pwanted in Table 7.6.2A.0-0 is set using ?RIBNC = 0 dB for all
sub-block gaps (Table 7.3A.0-3) while a band supporting contiguously aggregated carriers the out-of-band blocking
parameters in Table 7.6.2.3-1 are replaced by those specified in Table 7.6.2A.0-1. For each downlink the UE shall meet
the out-of-band blocking requirements applicable for inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band but with up to four component carriers assigned to the same band with the following exception. All
downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the requirements for the downlinks shall be met with the
single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.6.2.1A.
7.6.2A.1	Out-of-band blocking for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL CA)
7.6.2A.1.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band blocking for CA is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or
above the UE receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels in aggregated signals.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel
selectivity in sub-clause 7.5A and sub-clause 7.6.1A shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg , only the
combination with the highest NRB_PCC is tested.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.34 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.2A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.2A.1.4.3.
7.6.2A.1.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.2A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the CA Band according to Table
7.6.2A.1.5-2. The frequency step size is 1MHz.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.2A.1.5-1 for both carriers. Send uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that for at least the duration of the
throughput measurement:

7.6.2A.3	Out-of-band blocking for CA (inter-band DL CA without UL CA)
Editor's notes: This clause is incomplete for Band 46. The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined.
- Test system uncertainties are missing in annex F.
7.6.2A.3.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or above
(60 MHz for band 46) the UE receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement
for the specified measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above (60 MHz for band 46) the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or
adjacent channel selectivity in sub-clause 7.5.1 and sub-clause 7.6.1 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.2A.3.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support inter-band DL CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 2DL CA with FDD-TDD
inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support DL LAA.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration, which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table
5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value
according to table 7.3A.3.5-2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA
configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but
confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth
(Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration
(given UL is supported in PCC band as per Table 5.2-1).

7.6.2A.3.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.2 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the SCC’s operating band according to
Table 7.6.2 A.3.5-2, or Table 7.6.2A.3.5-2a for operating band 46 without uplink band. The frequency step size
is 1 MHz.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.2A.3.5-1 for both carriers. Send uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
+0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table 7.6.2A.3.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the
target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput of SCC for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
9. 	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using an interfering signal above the SCC’s operating band at step 6.
11.	Switch the SCell into PCell and repeat steps 1 to 10, except for operating bands without uplink band (as noted in
Table 5.2-1).
7.6.2A.3.4.3	Message Contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.6.2.4.3.
7.6.2A.3.5	Test Requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the out-of-band blocking requirements are
defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested i.e. the requirements are
tested only for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement for each component carrier, when operated as
SCell, while both downlink carriers are active.
Except for the spurious response frequencies recorded at step 9, the throughput measured during the test procedure for
each component carrier, when operated as SCell, shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.2A.3.5-1

7.6.2A.4.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.2 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.2A.4.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.4.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below the CA band according to Table
7.6.2.5-2. The frequency step size is 1 MHz.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.2.5-1 for both carriers. Send uplink power control
commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
+0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table 7.6.2.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the
target level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2A.
9. 	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements.
10.	Repeat steps from 6 to 9, using an interfering signal above the CA band at step 6.
7.6.2A.4.4.3	Message Contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.6.2.4.3.
7.6.2A.4.5	Test Requirement
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink carriers, the out-of-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration of the PCC being in accordance with table 7.3.1A-
3.The UE shall meet the requirements specified in tables 7.6.2A.4.5-1 and 7.6.2A.4.5-2 for each component carrier
while both downlink carriers are active.
The out-of-band blocking parameters in tables 7.6.2A.4.5-1 and 7.6.2A.4.5-2 for each component carrier are the same
as single carrier requirements in Tables 7.6.2.5-1 and 7.6.2.5-2.
For Table 7.6.2A.4.5-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, the number of spurious response frequencies recorded in the step
9 of the test procedure shall not exceed  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA channel per sub-block
gap of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies when measured using a 1MHz step
size. For these exceptions the requirements of subclause 7.7A.4 spurious response are applicable.
For Table 7.6.2A.4.5-2 in frequency range 4 the number of spurious response frequencies recorded in the step 9 of the
test procedure shall not exceed  exceptions per assigned E-UTRA channel per sub-block
gap of the E-UTRA CA configuration are allowed for spurious response frequencies when measured using a 1MHz step
size. For these exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7A.4 spurious response are applicable.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test
points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise
use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with
that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X and Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-
5A,X=2,Y=5
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-
41A,X=41.
Note 7:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation
for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB
allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the
same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination
with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.2A.5.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.2A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.2A.5.4.3.
7.6.2A.5.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.2A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.5.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the lowest CA Band according to
the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1. The
frequency step size is 1MHz. Use the highest ?RIB,c among CA bands for Pinterferer calculation.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table indicated in the column "Table with transmission parameters
to select" of Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step
size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table
7.6.2A.5.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in the Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements and for each frequency, the
carriers for which the throughput was not met.
10.	Repeat steps 6 to 8 for each recorded frequency-carrier pair, with exception of pairs for which ?RIB,c is the same
as ?RIB used in Step 6. In Step 6 use only recorded frequencies for interferer placement and use ?RIB,c relevant to
recorded carrier for Pinterferer calculation. Remove the frequency-carrier pairs that meet the throughput
requirements from the record.
11.	If the CA Configuration includes multiple bands, repeat steps from 6 to 10 using an interfering signal in each gap
between the CA bands, according to the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select"
of Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1.
12.	Repeat steps from 6 to 10, using an interfering signal above the highest CA Band according to the table indicated
in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1.
13.	Repeat steps 1 to 12 for each row of "Throughput measured on" column listed in the Table 7.6.2A.5.4.2-1.

Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose
the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.2A.7.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.2A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.2A.7.4.3.
7.6.2A.7.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.2A.7.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.7.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the lowest CA Band according to
the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1. The
frequency step size is 1MHz. Use the highest ?RIB,c among CA bands for Pinterferer calculation.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table indicated in the column "Table with transmission parameters
to select" of Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step
size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table
7.6.2A.7.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in the Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements and for each frequency, the
carriers for which the throughput was not met.
10.	Repeat steps 6 to 8 for each recorded frequency-carrier pair, with exception of pairs for which ?RIB,c is the same
as ?RIB used in Step 6. In Step 6 use only recorded frequencies for interferer placement and use ?RIB,c relevant to
recorded carrier for Pinterferer calculation. Remove the frequency-carrier pairs that meet the throughput
requirements from the record.
11.	If the CA Configuration includes multiple bands, repeat steps from 6 to 10 using an interfering signal in each gap
between the CA bands, according to the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select"
of Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1.
12.	Repeat steps from 6 to 10, using an interfering signal above the highest CA Band according to the table indicated
in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1.
13.	Repeat steps 1 to 12 for each row of "Throughput measured on" column listed in the Table 7.6.2A.7.4.2-1.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.2A.8.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.2A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.2A.8.4.3.
7.6.2A.8.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.2A.8.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.2A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.2A.8.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the lowest CA Band according to
the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1. The
frequency step size is 1MHz. Use the highest ?RIB,c among CA bands for Pinterferer calculation.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table indicated in the column "Table with transmission parameters
to select" of Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step
size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in table
7.6.2A.8.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in the Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements and for each frequency, the
carriers for which the throughput was not met.
10.	Repeat steps 6 to 8 for each recorded frequency-carrier pair, with exception of pairs for which ?RIB,c is the same
as ?RIB used in Step 6. In Step 6 use only recorded frequencies for interferer placement and use ?RIB,c relevant to
recorded carrier for Pinterferer calculation. Remove the frequency-carrier pairs that meet the throughput
requirements from the record.
11.	If the CA Configuration includes multiple bands, repeat steps from 6 to 10 using an interfering signal in each gap
between the CA bands, according to the table indicated in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select"
of Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1.
12.	Repeat steps from 6 to 10, using an interfering signal above the highest CA Band according to the table indicated
in the column "Table with interferer parameters to select" of Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1.
13.	Repeat steps 1 to 12 for each row of "Throughput measured on" column listed in the Table 7.6.2A.8.4.2-1.

7.6.2B	Out-of-band blocking for UL-MIMO
7.6.2B.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band band blocking for UL-MIMO is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz
below or above the UE that support UL- MIMO receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed
the requirement for the specified measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE that support UL-MIMO receive band the appropriate in-band blocking for
UL-MIMO or adjacent channel selectivity for UL-MIMO in sub-clause 7.5.3 and sub-clause 7.6.1.3 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.2B.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
7.6.2B.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements
in subclause 7.6 shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2. For UL-MIMO, the
parameter PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.6B.
7.6.2B.4	Test Description
7.6.2B.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.6.2B.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex

7.6.2D.1	Out-of-band blocking for ProSe Direct Discovery
Editor's note: This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	ProSe UE authentication is not handled in the test case and is still under investigation.
-	Use of OCNG for Downlink has not been considered and is still FFS.
-	Message exceptions content needs further investigation (some values still TBD).
-	Test time is FFS.
7.6.2D.1.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band blocking for ProSe is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or
above the ProSe band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels in aggregated signals.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the ProSe band the appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel selectivity in
sub-clause 7.5D and sub-clause 7.6.1D shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).

(only those marked with "…Step 1…" ) are defined in clause 7.6.2D.1.4.3.
2.	The UE shall transmit RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
3.	Initialise the variables Ptot and Pok as 0.
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.3D.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.6.2D.1.4.1-1. When the UE has no payload data to send, it transmits uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the Sidelink Band according to
Table 7.6.2D.1.5-2. The frequency step size is 1MHz.
7.	SS transmits PSDCH to transmit the SL RMC according to Table 7.6.2D.1.4.1-1. Set the Sidelink signal level to
the appropriate value defined in Table 7.6.2D.1.5-1.
8.	SS shall send SL Discovery Packets (MAC padding bits) on the SL RMC for the test time [FFS]. SS stores the
number of the transmitted Discovery Packets in the current test iteration in the variable Ptot.
9.	SS shall send (on the available PDSCH) a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT
DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER REQUEST" message and wait for the UE to respond (on the available
PUSCH) with a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER
RESPONSE".
10.	SS calculates the variable Pok as (current counter value - counter value at last test iteration).
11.	SS shall compute the throughput as following:
TP = Pok / Ptot * 100%
12.	Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn't meet the requirements.
13.	Repeat steps from 6 to 12, using an interfering signal above the Sidelink Band at step 6.

7.6.2G.1	Out-of-band blocking for V2X Communication/ Non-concurrent with E-UTRA
uplink transmissions
Editor's note: This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
--	Message contents are TBD
-	UE test mode is TBD
7.6.2G.1.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band blocking for V2X is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or
above the V2X band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels in aggregated signals.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the V2X band the appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel selectivity in
sub-clause 7.5G and sub-clause 7.6.1G shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.2G.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X Communication.
7.6.2G.1.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annex A.8.2 with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.2G.3-1, 7.6.2G.3-2.
For Table 7.6.2G.3-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to  exceptions are allowed for
spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where
is the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.4.2-1). For these
exceptions the requirements of subclause 7.7G Spurious response are applicable.

7.6.2EA	Out-of-band blocking for UE category M1
7.6.2EA.1	Test Purpose
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling more than 15 MHz below or above
the category M1 UE receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the
specified measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel
selectivity in sub-clause 7.5EA.1 and sub-clause 7.6.1EA shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.2EA.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.

7.6.3A	Narrow band blocking for CA
7.6.3A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the narrow-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the
band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.6.3 for each
component carrier while all downlink carriers are active. For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band
without uplink band or an operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all
downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. For E-UTRA CA
configurations listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a under conditions for which reference sensitivity for the operating band being
tested is N/A, the narrow-band blocking requirements of subclause 7.6.3A.0 do not apply. For E-UTRA CA
configurations with a component carrier assigned in Band 46, narrow-band blocking requirements do not apply in the
presence of a narrow-band interferer in Band 46.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to
the PCC. For FDD, the PCC shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers shall be active
throughout the test. The uplink output power shall be set as specified in Table 7.6.3A.0-1 with the uplink configuration
set according to Table 7.3A.0-1 for the applicable carrier aggregation configuration. For UE(s) supporting one uplink,
the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2.
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement in presence of an interfering signal specified in Table 7.6.3A.0-1 being on
either side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in
Table 7.6.3A.0-1. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements also apply
for an SCC assigned in the unpaired part with parameters specified in Table 7.6.3A.0-1.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, the narrow
band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3. For this
uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in subclauses 7.6.3.3 and
7.6.3A.0 for one component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply for
in-gap and out-of-gap interferers while all downlink carriers are active.

Note 1:	The transmitter shall be set to 4dB below PCMAX_L or PCMAX_L_CA as defined in subclause 6.2.5A.
Note 2:	Reference measurement channel is specified in Annex A.3.2 with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
Note 3:	The Fuw (offset) is the frequency separation of the centre frequency of the carrier closest to the interferer and
the centre frequency of the interferer and shall be further adjusted to  MHz
to be offset from the sub-carrier raster.
Note 4:	The requirement is applied for the band combinations whose component carriers’ BW≥5 MHz.

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguously sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and one uplink carrier
assigned to one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in a band other than that supporting the
downlink(s) under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is active
in the band supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than the
downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component
carriers. For these uplink configurations, the UE shall meet the narrow-band blocking requirements for intra-band non-
contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink sub-blocks with ?RIBNC = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table 7.3A.0-3)
for the two non-contiguous downlink sub-blocks, the requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for the
contiguously aggregated downlink carriers and for any remaining component carrier(s) the requirements specified in
subclause 7.6.3. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the requirements for the downlinks shall
be met with the single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation.
For E-UTRA CA configurations with a component carriers assigned in Band 46, narrow-band blocking requirements do
not apply in the presence of a narrow-band interferer in Band 46.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.6.3.1A.
7.6.3A.1	Narrow band blocking for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL CA)
7.6.3A.1.1	Test Purpose
Verifies a receiver's ability to receive an E-UTRA signal at its assigned CA channel frequencies in the presence of an
unwanted narrow band CW interferer at a frequency, which is less than the nominal channel spacing.
The lack of narrow-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.3A.1.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA.
7.6.3A.1.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.6.3A.0.
7.6.3A.1.4	Test Description
7.6.3A.1.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 7.6.3A.1.4.1-1. The details of the OCNG patterns used
are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA Configuration only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1 is
tested per CA Configuration Test CC combination.
Note 3:	If the UE supports multiple CC Combinations in the CA Configuration with the same NRB_agg, only the
fcombination with the highest NRB_PCC irst of those is tested, according to the order on the Test
Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.34 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are for PCC initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.3A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in

Note 4:	For CA_70C all test frequency IDs shall be tested according to table 4.3.1.1.70A-1, in TS 36.508 [7].

7.6.3A.2.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.3A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3A.2.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers
according to Table 7.6.3A.1.5-1. The interferer frequency is adjusted in analogy with table 7.6.3A.2.4.2-1.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3A.1.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3A.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table
7.3A.3.5-2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but confined within the
transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration, according to the UE
declared capability for UL support (within CA operation) in the individual bands. (given UL is supported in
PCC band as per Table 5.2-1).

7.6.3A.3.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.3A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3A.3.4.1-1 on PCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the
UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the SCC according to Table
7.6.3A.3.5-1.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3A.3.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3A.3.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput of SCC for duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex G.2.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the SCC at step 6.
7.6.3A.3.4.3	Message Contents
Same message contents as in clause 7.6.3.4.3.
7.6.3A.3.5	Test Requirement
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the narrow-band blocking requirements
are defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested, i.e. the requirements
are tested only for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement for each component carrier, when operated
as SCell, while both downlink carriers are active.
The throughput measured during the test procedure for each component carrier, when operated as SCell, shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters
specified in Table 7.6.3A.3.5-1 (originated from the single carrier Table 7.6.3.5-1).

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.3A.5.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.3A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.3A.5.4.3.
7.6.3A.5.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.3A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.3A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.5.4.1-5 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.5.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers
according to Table 7.6.3A.5.4.2-1.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3A.5.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3A.5.4.2-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in Table 7.6.3A.5.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to Table
7.6.3A.5.4.2-1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps 1 to 9 for component carriers listed in Table 7.6.3A.5.4.2-1.

Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-
4A,X=2,Y=4.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose
the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.3A.7.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.3A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.3A.7.4.3.
7.6.3A.7.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.3A.7.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.3A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.7.4.1-6 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.7.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers
according to Table 7.6.3A.7.4.2-1.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3A.7.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3A.7.4.2-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in Table 7.6.3A.7.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to Table
7.6.3A.7.4.2-1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps 1 to 9 for component carriers listed in Table 7.6.3A.7.4.2-1.

Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	Test configuration tables are undefined.
-	Initial conditions and test procedure are still undefined.
-	Parameters of the CW signal generator are undefined.
7.6.3A.8.1	Test Purpose
Same test purpose as 7.6.3A.1.
7.6.3A.8.2	Test Applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 5DL with TDD Intra-band
contiguous CA, or 5DL with Inter-band CA, or 5DL with Intra-band contiguous and Inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support 5DL with Intra-band non-
contiguous and Inter-band CA or 5DL with Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band contiguous CA, or 5DL with
Intra-band non-contiguous and Intra-band non-contiguous CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 5DL CA with FDD-TDD
CA.
7.6.3A.8.3	Minimum Conformance Requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.6.3A.0.
7.6.3A.8.4	Test Description
7.6.3A.8.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1 through table 5.4.2A.1-3. All of these configurations shall be
tested with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.6.3A.8.4.1-1 through table
7.6.3A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band contiguous & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use the
Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	Inter-band & Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points
with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41F, X=41.
Note 6: 	Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R,S correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-7A-20A-42A,X=1,Y=3,Z=7,R=20,S=42.
Note 7: 	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z,R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-3A-28A-42C, X=1, Y=3, Z=28 and R=42.
Note 8:	REFSENS refers to the PCC bands and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose for testing the Combination with maximum NRB_PCC and then
select maximum NRB_SCC1 for the chosen NRB_PCC.
Note 10:	Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, choose the Combination with NRB_PCC = NRB_SCC1 for
testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_PCC for testing.

TBD
Default Test Settings for a CA_XA-XA-YA-YA-ZA Configuration (Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous)
TBD
Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 4:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X, Y, Z, R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-5A-12A-66A, X=2, Y=5, Z=12 and R=66.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_48A-48E, X=48.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X, Y, Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A, X=3, Y=7 and Z=8.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If
no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.6.3A.8.4.1-1 through Table
7.6.3A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6.3A.8.4.3.
7.6.3A.8.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. 	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.6.3A.8.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.3A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.6.3A.8.4.1-2 on PCC. Since the UE
has no payload data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the aggregated component carriers
according to Table 7.6.3A.8.4.2-1.
7.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3A.8.4.2-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3A.8.4.2-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in Table 7.6.3A.8.4.2-1 for duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to Table
7.6.3A.8.4.2-1 at step 6.
10.	Repeat steps 1 to 9 for component carriers listed in Table 7.6.3A.8.4.2-1.

For a UE, which supports CA configuration in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B, 7.3.3-1C and 7.3.3-1D, Puw power defined in
Table 7.6.3A.8.5-1 and 7.6.3A.8.5-2 is increased by the amount given by ΔRIB,c in Tables 7.3.3-1A, 7.3.3-1B, 7.3.3-1C
and 7.3.3-1D.
7.6.3B	Narrow band blocking for UL-MIMO
7.6.3B.1	Test Purpose
Narrow band blocking for UL-MIMO is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal falling near the UE that
supports UL-MIMO receive band, at which a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the
specified measurement channels,
The lack of narrow-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when other e-NodeB transmitters exist (except
in the adjacent channels and spurious response).
7.6.3B.2	Test Applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements
in clause 7.6 shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2. For UL-MIMO, the parameter
PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.
7.6.3B.4	Test Description
7.6.3B.4.1	Initial Conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.6.3B.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex
C.2.

7.6.3EA.4.2	Test Procedure
1.	SS transmits PDSCH via MPDCCH DCI format 6-1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.1EA.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The SS sends one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6.3EA.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send,
the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal below the wanted signal according to
Table 7.6.3EA.5-1.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.6.3EA.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the
UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of
the target level in table 7.6.3EA.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal at step 3.

7.7	Spurious response
7.7.1	Test Purpose
Spurious response verifies the receiver's ability to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without
exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other frequency at
which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band blocking limit as specified in sub-clause 7.6.2 is not met.
The lack of the spurious response ability decreases the coverage area when other unwanted interfering signal exists at
any other frequency.

7.7A	Spurious response for CA
7.7A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink assigned to one E-
UTRA band the spurious response requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the band
whose downlink is being tested. The throughput measured in each downlink with Finterferer in Table 7.6.2A.0-0 and Table
7.6.2A.0-0a at spurious response frequencies shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.7.3-1 and 7.7.3-2. The UE
shall meet these requirements for each component carrier while all downlink carriers are active.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink active in two E-UTRA
bands, the spurious response requirements applicable specified above shall be met with the transmitter power for the
uplink set to 7 dB below PCMAX_L,c for each serving cell c.
For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without uplink band or an operating band with an unpaired
DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink active in each
band capable of UL operation. For E-UTRA CA configurations listed in Table 7.3A.0-0a under conditions for which
reference sensitivity for the operating band being tested is N/A, the spurious response requirements of subclause 7.7A.0
do not apply.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to
the PCC. For FDD, the PCC shall configure closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers shall be active throughout
the test. The uplink output power shall be set as specified in Table 7.7A.0-1 with the uplink configuration set according
to Table 7.3A.0-1 for the applicable carrier aggregation configuration. For UE(s) supporting one uplink carrier, the
uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2. The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with
parameters specified in Tables 7.7A.0-1 and 7.7A.0-2. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table
5.2-1), the requirements also apply for an SCC assigned in the unpaired part with parameters specified in Tables
7.7A.0-1 and 7.7A.0-2.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks, the spurious
response requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in subclauses 7.7.3 and 7.7A.0 for one
component carrier and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply with all downlink
carriers active.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two uplink carriers and two downlink carriers, the spurious
response requirements applicable specified above shall be met with the transmitter powers for the uplinks set to
PCMAX_L,c ? 7 dBm.

For combinations of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation with up to five downlink carriers (up to two non-
contiguously sub-blocks per band and up to four contiguously aggregated carriers per band) and one uplink carrier
assigned to one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in a band other than that supporting the
downlink(s) under test. The uplink configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3A.0-3 when the uplink is active
in the band supporting two non-contiguous component carriers, Table 7.3A.0-1 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting two contiguous component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.3-2 when the uplink is active in a band
supporting one carrier per band. The downlink PCC shall be configured closer to the uplink operating band than the
downlink SCC(s) when the uplink is active in band(s) supporting contiguous aggregation of up to four component
carriers. For the two non-contiguous component carriers within the same band, Pwanted in Table 7.6.2A.0-0 is set using
?RIBNC = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table 7.3A.0-3) while a band supporting contiguously aggregated carriers the
out-of-band blocking parameters in Table 7.7.3-1 are replaced by those specified in Table 7.7A.0-1. For each downlink
the UE shall meet the spurious-response requirements applicable for inter-band carrier aggregation with one component
carrier per operating band but with up to three component carriers assigned to the same band. All downlink carriers
shall be active throughout the tests and the requirements for the downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier
active in each band capable of UL operation.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.7.1A.

7.7B	Spurious response for UL-MIMO
7.7B.1	Test Purpose
Spurious response verifies the ability of the UE that support UL-MIMO to receive a wanted signal on its assigned
channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at
any other frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band blocking limit as specified in sub-
clause 7.6B.2 is not met.
The lack of the spurious response ability decreases the coverage area when other unwanted interfering signal exists at
any other frequency.

1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2B.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.6B.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal according to Table 7.7B.5-2. The
spurious frequencies are taken from records in the final step of test procedures in clause 7.6B.2.4.2.
4.	Set the downlink signal level according to the table 7.7B.5-1. Send uplink power control commands to the UE
(less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the
target level in table 7.7B.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
5.	For the spurious frequency, measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G.2.

7.7D.1	Spurious response for ProSe Direct Discovery
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	ProSe UE authentication is not handled in the test case and is still under investigation.
-	Use of OCNG for Downlink has not been considered and is still FFS.
-	Message exceptions content needs further investigation (some values still TBD).
-	Test time is FFS.
7.7D.1.1	Test Purpose
Spurious response for ProSe verifies the receiver's ability to receive a wanted aggregated signal on its assigned channel
frequency without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other
frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band blocking limit as specified in sub-clause 7.6.2D
is not met.
The lack of the spurious response ability decreases the coverage area when other unwanted interfering signal exists at
any other frequency.

1.	SS shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to configure DRX. Message contents exceptions
(only those marked with "…Step 1…" ) are defined in clause 7.7D.1.4.3.
2.	The UE shall transmit RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
3.	Initialise the variables Ptot and Pok as 0.
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.6.2D.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.6.2D.1.4.1-1. When the UE has no payload data to send, it transmits uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal according to Table 7.7D.1.5-2. The
spurious frequencies are taken from records in step 12 of test procedures in clause 7.6.2D.1.4.2.
7.	SS transmits PSDCH to transmit the SL RMC according to Table 7.6.2D.1.4.1-1. Set the Sidelink signal level to
the appropriate value defined in Table 7.7D.1.5-1.
8.	SS shall send SL Discovery Packets (MAC padding bits) on the SL RMC for the test time [FFS]. SS stores the
number of the transmitted Discovery Packets in the current test iteration in the variable Ptot.
9.	SS shall send (on the available PDSCH) a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT
DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER REQUEST" message and wait for the UE to respond (on the available
PUSCH) with a "UE TEST LOOP PROSE MODE D SIDELINK DIRECT DISCOVERY PACKET COUNTER
RESPONSE".
10.	SS calculates the variable Pok as (current counter value - counter value at last test iteration).
11.	SS shall compute the throughput as following:
	TP = Pok / Ptot * 100%
12.	Repeat steps from 6 to 11 for all frequencies recorded in step 12 of the test procedure in clause 7.6.2D.1.4.2.

2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1.5-1. Send Uplink power control commands
to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4
dB of the target level in Table 7.8.1.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
4.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table 7.8.1.5-1 and frequency below the wanted
signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.

For contiguously aggregated component carriers configured in Band 46, the said requirements for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation of two downlink carriers are replaced by requirements in Table 7.8.1A.0-2. For non-contiguously
aggregated component carriers configured in Band 46, the said requirements are applied to each sub-block for out-of-
gap interferers. For the sub-block with a single component carrier, the requirement is replaced by Table 7.8.1A.0-0. For
the sub-block with two or more contiguous component carriers, the requirement is replaced by Table 7.8.1A.0-1. All
downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests and the requirements for the downlinks shall be met with the
single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation.

7.8.1A.3	Wideband intermodulation for CA (inter-band DL CA without UL CA)
7.8.1A.3.1	Test purpose
Intermodulation response tests the UE's ability to receive data with a given average throughput for a specified reference
measurement channel, in the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to
the wanted signal, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when two or
more interfering signals exist which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.
7.8.1A.3.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that supports inter-band contiguous DL CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 12 and forward that support 2DL CA with FDD-TDD
inter-band CA.
This test case also applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support DL LAA.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration, which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table
5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value
according to table 7.3A.3.5-2 for UE supporting one uplink carrier is tested per Test CA
configuration.
Note 3:	The UL resource blocks shall be located as close as possible to the downlink PCC but
confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth
(Table 5.4.2-1).
Note 4:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration,
according to the UE declared capability for UL support (within CA operation) in the
individual bands.

1.	Connect the SS and interfering sources to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Figure group
A.34 as appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the
band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
5.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.8.1A.3.4.3.
7.8.1A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.8.1A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1A.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1A.3.5-0 for operating band 46 or Table
7.8.1A.3.5-1. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to
ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level in Table 7.8.1A.3.5-0 for operating
band 46 or Table 7.8.1A.3.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table 7.8.1A.3.5-0 for operating band 46 without

Same message contents as in clause 7.8.1.4.3.
7.8.1A.3.5	Test requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the in-band blocking requirements are
defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is being tested, i.e., the requirements are
tested only for the SCell downlink. The UE shall meet the requirement for each component carrier, when operated as
SCell, while both downlink carriers are active.
The throughput measured during the test procedure for each component carrier, when operated as SCell, shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters
specified in Table 7.8.1A.3.5-0 for band combinations including operating band 46 without uplink operation and Table
7.8.1A.3.5-1 (originated from the single carrier Table 7.8.1.5-1).
The test requirements do not apply when the interfering signal overlaps with the channel bandwidth of any downlink
CC.

7.8.1A.5.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1 through table 5.4.2A.1-2a. All of these configurations shall be
tested with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.8.1A.5.4.1-1 through table
7.8.1A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test
points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table. Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table, otherwise
use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 4:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with
that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X and Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-
5A,X=2,Y=5
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-
41A,X=41.
Note 7:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation
for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB
allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 9:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the
same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.8.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table
7.8.1A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.8.1A.5.4.3.
7.8.1A.5.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.8.1A.5.4.3
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.8.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.8.1A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1A.5.4.1-1 through Table 7.8.1A.5.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC
and SCCs. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1A.5.5-1 or 7.8.1A.5.5-2. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power
is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in 7.8.1A.5.5-1 or 7.8.1A.5.5-2 and frequency below the
measured carrier(s) according to table 7.8.1A.5.4.2-1, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in
Annex D of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.8.1A.5.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table
7.8.1A.5.4.2-1.
10. 	Repeat steps 6 to 9 for component carriers listed in table 7.8.1A.5.4.2-1.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use test points from matching Group Test Settings, if present in the table.
Otherwise use Default Test Settings test points.
Note 3:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band
as PCC are not applicable.
Note 4:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X,Y,Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A,X=2,Y=4,Z=12.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_41C-41A-41A,X=41.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-4A-
4A,X=2,Y=4.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose
the Combination with NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.8.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table
7.8.1A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.3A.5.4.3.
7.8.1A.7.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.8.1A.7.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.8.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table7.8.1A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1A.7.4.1-1 through Table 7.8.1A.7.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC
and SCCs. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1A.7.5-1 or 7.8.1A.7.5-2. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power
is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in 7.8.1A.7.5-1 or 7.8.1A.7.5-2 and frequency below the
measured carrier(s) according to table 7.8.1A.7.4.2-1, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in
Annex D of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.8.1A.7.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table
7.8.1A.7.4.2-1.
10. 	Repeat steps 6 to 9 for component carriers listed in table 7.8.1A.7.4.2-1.

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.8.1A.0.
7.8.1A.8.4	Test description
7.8.1A.8.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1 through table 5.4.2A.1-3. All of these configurations shall be
tested with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.8.1A.8.4.1-1 through table
7.8.1A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 3:	If, according to the UE declared capability, UE does not support UL in an individual band within the CA Configuration, test points with that individual band as PCC are not applicable.
Note 4:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band: X, Y, Z, R correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_2A-2A-5A-12A-66A, X=2, Y=5, Z=12 and R=66.
Note 5:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: X corresponds to the band of the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_48A-48E, X=48.
Note 6:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band non-contiguous: X, Y, Z correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A, X=3, Y=7 and Z=8.
Note 7:	REFSENS refers to the PCC band’s and PCC NRB ‘s single carrier Uplink RB allocation for reference sensitivity according to table 7.3.5-2.
Note 8:	Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous: If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , choose the Combination with
NRB_CC1 = NRB_CC2 for testing. If no such combination is supported, choose Combination with maximum NRB_CC1 for testing.



1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.58 as
appropriate if the UE supports 2 Rx antennas or Figure A.82 if the UE supports 4 Rx antennas in the band.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.1, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.8.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table
7.8.1A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.8.1A.8.4.3.
7.8.1A.8.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCCs according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.1 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCCs as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
7.8.1A.8.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCCs by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.8.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.8.1A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC and SCCs. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.
5.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1A.8.4.1-1 through Table 7.8.1A.8.4.1-2 as appropriate on PCC
and SCCs. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
6.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1A.8.5-1 or 7.8.1A.8.5-2. Send Uplink power
control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power
is within +0, - 3.4 dB of the target level for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target level
for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement.
7.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in 7.8.1A.8.5-1 or 7.8.1A.8.5-2 and frequency below the
measured carrier(s) according to table 7.8.1A.8.4.2-1, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in
Annex D of the present document.
8.	Measure the average throughput for the carrier(s) indicated in table 7.8.1A.8.4.2-1 for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex G.2A.
9.	Repeat steps from 6 to 8, using an interfering signal above the measured carrier(s) according to table
7.8.1A.8.4.2-1.
10.	Repeat steps 6 to 9 for component carriers listed in table 7.8.1A.8.4.2-1.

Intermodulation response tests the ability of UE that support UL-MIMO to receive data with a given average throughput
for a specified reference measurement channel, in the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal, under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.
A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions will decrease the coverage area when two or
more interfering signals exist which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.
7.8.1B.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
7.8.1B.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the minimum
requirements in subclause 7.8.1B.3 shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2. For
UL-MIMO, the parameter PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 7.8.1B and TS 36.101 [2] Annexes A and D.
7.8.1B.4	Test description
7.8.1B.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 7.8.1B.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3 respectively. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex
C.2.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, which
applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on E-UTRA band, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according
to table 7.3.3-2 is tested per Test Channel Bandwidth.
Note 3:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.
Note 4:	Applicable only to E-UTRA FDD Band 31. The UL resource blocks shall be located at
RBstart 10 (according to Table 7.3.3-2).

1.	Connect the SS and interfering sources to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Figure A.31.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.1, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.1.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 7.8.1B.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

1.	SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
7.8.1B.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 7.8.1B.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.8.1B.5-1. Send Uplink power control commands
to the UE (less or equal to 1dB step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within +0, - 3.4
dB of the target level in Table 7.8.1B.5-1 for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or within +0, -4.0 dB of the target
level for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz, for at least the duration of the throughput measurement.
4.	Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table 7.8.1B.5-1 and frequency below the wanted
signal, using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D of the present document.
5.	Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
G.2.
6.	Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the wanted signal at step 4.
