6	Transmitter Characteristics
6.1	General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the antenna connector of the UE with a single
transmit antenna. For UE with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed.
The transient periods due to power steps, OFF/ON and ON/OFF transitions could occur at slot or symbol boundary with
transients, on one or both sides of the boundary. The measurement period and whether to exclude the transient periods
are specified in the respective sections below.
Unless otherwise stated, the Test Equipment shall be synchronised to the Uplink signal for measurement of TDD
transmitter characteristics.
For CA tests, Cell ID = 0 applies to P-Cell, and Cell ID = 1 is used for S-Cell.
Parameters given in table 6.1-1 are used throughout this section for CA, unless otherwise stated by the test case.

For CA testing, unless otherwise stated, the logical carriers PCC / SCCs are mapped to physical frequencies as defined
in Table 6.1-2.

Note 1:	Notation CCi-CCj means PCC on component carrier CCi and SCC on
component carrier CCj, with CCi/j frequencies defined in the corresponding
intra-band contiguous CA band in TS36.508 [7].
Note 2:	Notation Bi?Bj means PCC on component Band i and SCC on component
Band j, with single Band i/j frequencies defined in TS36.508 [7].
Note 3:	Applicable for UE declared capability of UL support (within CA operation) in
the individual bands. If UE does not support both PCC-SCC mappings, only
the supported mapping is applicable.
Note 4:	Applicable for TDD CA and FDD CA bands with UL frequency < DL
frequency.
Note 5:	Applicable for FDD CA bands with UL frequency > DL frequency.

For testing of category 0 HD-FDD UE in FDD operating bands, the SS shall ensure downlink transmission is only
configured in downlink subframes and that UL grants are given to ensure UE is transmitting only in uplink subframes
throughout the test. The subframes reserved for uplink and downlink respectively are specified in the RMC definition in
Annex A.2 for uplink and Annex A.3 for downlink.
For testing of category NB1 in all operation bands, standalone is used as default operation mode unless otherwise stated
by the test case.
6.2	Transmit power
6.2.1	Void
Editor's note:	This "void" section was introduced because TS 36.101 v8.1.0 also contains a "void" sub-clause within
the transmit power clause 6.2, and there is a strong desire in RAN5 to keep the test cases clauses
numbering matching their specific core requirements as much as possible.
6.2.2	UE Maximum Output Power
Editor’s notes: The test applicability of Maximum Output Power for Band 47 is need to be checked.
6.2.2.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of the UE maximum output power does not exceed the range prescribed by the specified
nominal maximum output power and tolerance.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.
6.2.2.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward.
6.2.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The following UE Power Classes defines the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth within the
channel bandwidth. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, the applicable
channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	For E-UTRA bands not applied with Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1:
-	The 1 RB allocation shall be tested at RB#0 for low and mid range, RB #max for high
range test frequency.
-	The RBstart of non-1RB allocation shall be RB #0 for low and mid range, RB# (max +1 -
RB allocation) for high range test frequency.
Note 3:	For E-UTRA bands applied with Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1:
-	If the test channel bandwidth is larger than 4MHz, then the 1 RB allocation shall be
tested at both RB #0 and RB #max.
-	If the test channel bandwidth is smaller or equal to 4MHz, then the 1 RB allocation shall
be tested at RB #0.
-	If the test channel bandwidth = (FUL_high - FUL_low) specified by the operating band,
then only one frequency range shall be tested and the 1 RB allocation shall be tested at
RB #0, RB #  and RB #max.
-	For non-1RB allocation, test frequency is middle range, and the RBstart shall be RB #0.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send
the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE;
allow at least 200ms for the UE to reach PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode. The period of
measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient
periods are not under test.
6.2.2.4.3	Message contents

Note 3:	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified without taking into account the tolerance
Note 4:	For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the maximum power requirement should apply to the total
transmitted power over all component carriers (per UE).

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier on the PCC, the requirements in subclause
6.2.2 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.2A.
6.2.2A.1	UE Maximum Output Power for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL
CA)
6.2.2A.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of UE maximum output power in intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation does not exceed the
range prescribed by the specified CA Power Class and tolerance.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.
6.2.2A.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA.
6.2.2A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.2.2A.0.
6.2.2A.1.4	Test description
6.2.2A.1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 6.2.2A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.2A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.2A.1.4.3.
6.2.2A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.2A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.2A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE;
allow at least 200ms for the UE to reach PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean transmitted power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access
mode. The period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD
slots with transient periods are not under test.
6.2.2A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
6.2.2A.1.5	Test Requirements
The maximum output power for the CA configuration, derived in step 3 shall be within the range prescribed by the CA
UE Power Class and tolerance in Table 6.2.2A.1.5-1.

Note 1:	Void
Note 2:	For transmission bandwidths (Figure 5.4.2-1) confined within FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4
MHz and FUL_high, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by reducing the lower tolerance limit
by 1.5 dB
Note 3:	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified without taking into account the tolerance
Note 4:	For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the maximum power requirement should apply to the total
transmitted power over all component carriers (per UE).
Note 5:	Lower limit is assuming ΔTC,c and ΔTIB,c are zero. If non-zero, PCMAX,c will decrease and T(PCMAX_L,c) may
be higher resulting in different test requirements according to Table 6.2.5A.1.3-1.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the
ΔTIB,c in Tables 6.2.5.3-2, 6.2.5.3-3 and 6.2.5.3-4 shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the above inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 6.2.5.3-2, truncated to one decimal place for that operating band among the
supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then
the maximum tolerance among the different supported carrier aggregation configurations involving such band
shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 6.2.5.3-2 that applies for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations.

Editor’s Note: This test case is incomplete. The following items are missing or are incomplete:
-Test Configuration Table is incomplete
-The test applicability is incomplete
-The test applicability needs to be added to TS36.521-2

6.2.2A.4.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of UE maximum output power in intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation does not exceed the
range prescribed by the specified CA Power Class and tolerance.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.
6.2.2A.4.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support intra-band contiguous 3DL CA
and 3UL CA.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.2A.4.1.4.1-1.ji3
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.2A.4.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE;
allow at least 200ms for the UE to reach PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean transmitted power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access

In case the UE supports more than one of the above inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 6.2.5.3-2, truncated to one decimal place for that operating band among the
supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then
the maximum tolerance among the different supported carrier aggregation configurations involving such band
shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 6.2.5.3-2 that applies for that operating band among the supported CA

4.	The UL and V2X Reference Measurement Channels are set according to Table 6.2.2G.2.4.1-1
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-V2X according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2C. Message content exceptions
are defined in clause 6.2.2G.2.4.3.
6.2.2G.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	The SS simultaneously sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI
format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC and V2X scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 5A for
SL_V_RNTI to schedule the V2X RMC according to Table 6.2.2G.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL and V2X RMCs.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level. Configure the UE to transmit PSCCH and PSSCH with the PUMAX
level of each test points.
3.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the V2X con-current band configuration. The period of
measurement shall be at least continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms).

6.2.3	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR)
Editor's note:
- Requirement for Band 44 is not yet finalised due to square brackets in core specification TS 36.101 Table 6.2.2-1.
- Test requirements values in this section need to be reviewed in order to take into account notes in Table 6.2.5.3-2:
ΔTIB,c regarding ΔTIB,c and asymmetric lower tolerances in table 6.2.2.3-1.
6.2.3.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for adjacent channel leakage ratio
and the maximum power reduction (MPR) due to Cubic Metric (CM).
Simple scaling can be used to derive the requirement for other bandwidth based on the previously agreed value for
5MHz channel bandwidth.
6.2.3.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test cases 6.6.2.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio to all types of E-UTRA
Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table
6.2.2.3-1 due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table
6.2.3.3-1.

For PRACH, PUCCH and SRS transmission, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For each subframe, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot, the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5.3 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.2.3.

6.2.3_2	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for Multi-Cluster PUSCH
6.2.3_2.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of the UE maximum output power does not exceed the range prescribed by the specified
maximum output power with MPR and tolerance when operating in multi-cluster PUSCH scenarios.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.
6.2.3_2.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test cases 6.6.2.3_2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio to all types of E-
UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support multi cluster PUSCH within a component carrier for the tested band but
do not support UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3_2 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3_2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in table 6.2.2-1
due to multi-cluster PUSCH, is specified as follows:
MPR = CEIL {MA, 0.5}
Where MA is defined as follows
MA = 8.00-10.12A; 0.00< A ≤ 0.33
5.67 - 3.07A; 0.33< A ≤0.77
3.31;        0.77< A ≤1.00
Where
A = NRB_alloc / NRB.
CEIL{MA, 0.5} means rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB, i.e. MPR ? [3.0, 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0]
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in clause 6.2.5.3 apply.

6.2.3_3	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for UL 64QAM
Editor's note:
- Requirement for Band 44 is not yet finalised due to square brackets in core specification TS 36.101 Table 6.2.2-1.
- Test requirements values in this section need to be reviewed in order to take into account notes in Table 6.2.5.3-2:
ΔTIB,c regarding ΔTIB,c and asymmetric lower tolerances in table 6.2.2.3-1.
6.2.3_3.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3_3.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for adjacent channel leakage
ratio and the maximum power reduction (MPR) due to Cubic Metric (CM).
Simple scaling can be used to derive the requirement for other bandwidth based on the previously agreed value for
5MHz channel bandwidth.
6.2.3_3.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test cases 6.6.2.3_3 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio to E-UTRA UE from
release 13 and forward that support UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3_3 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3_3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table
6.2.2.3-1 due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table
6.2.3_3.3-1.

For each subframe, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot, the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5.3 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.2.3.

6.2.3A	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA
6.2.3A.1	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA)
6.2.3A.1.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3A.1.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (ACLR) for CA and the maximum power reduction (MPR) for intra-band contiguous CA Bandwidth Class
C due to Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3A.1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3A.1 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA to all
types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL CA.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3A.1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum
output power in Table 6.2.2A.0-2 due to higher order modulation and contiguously allocated transmissions
(resource blocks) is specified in Table 6.2.3A.1.3-1. In case the modulation format is different on different
component carriers then the MPR is determined by the rules applied to higher order of those modulations.

For PUCCH and SRS transmission, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation for
the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For intra-band contiguous CA Bandwidth Class C with non-contiguous resource allocation the allowed Maximum
Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2A.0-2 is specified as follows:
	MPR = CEIL { min(MA, MIM5), 0.5}
Where MA is defined as follows:
	MA = 	8.2; 				0 ≤ A < 0.025
			9.2 - 40A; 		0.025 ≤ A < 0.05
			8 - 16A; 			0.05 ≤ A < 0.25
			4.83 - 3.33A; 		0.25 ≤ A ≤ 0.4
			3.83 - 0.83A; 		0.4 ≤ A ≤ 1
and MIM5 is defined as follows
   MIM5 =		4.5		; ?IM5 < 1.5 * BWChannel_CA
   6.0		; 1.5 * BWChannel_CA ≤ ?IM5 < BWChannel_CA/2 + FOOB
   MA		; ?IM5 ≥ BWChannel_CA/2 + FOOB
Where
	A = NRB_alloc / NRB_agg.
	?IM5 = max( | FC_agg ? (3*Fagg_alloc_low ? 2*Fagg_alloc_high) |,  | FC_agg  ? (3*Fagg_alloc_high ? 2*Fagg_alloc_low) | )
	FC_agg = (Fedge_high + Fedge_low)/2
	CEIL{MA, 0.5} means rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB, i.e. MPR ∈[3.0, 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5,
8.0, 8.5]
For intra-band carrier aggregation, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the
transmission(s) on all component carriers within the slot, the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the
entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in sub-clause 6.2.5A.1 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.3A.
6.2.3A.1.4	Test description
6.2.3A.1.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.3A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

NOTE 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which applicable
aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
NOTE 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of those is
tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS and interfering sources to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A,
Figure group A.32 as appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.3A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.3A.1.4.3.
6.2.3A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.3A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the MAC-CE according to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8. Wait for at
least 2 seconds as per TS 36.133 [4] clause 8.3.3.2.
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.3A.1.4.1-1on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access mode. The
period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.
6.2.3A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
6.2.3A.1.5	Test Requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 2 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum output
power and tolerance in Table 6.2.3A.1.5-1 or Table.6.2.3A.1.5-2, as applicable.

6.2.3A.1_1	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA) for UL 64QAM
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	Minimum conformance requirements are missing for aggregated BW 15+10 MHz.
6.2.3A.1_1.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3A.1_1.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA for UL 64QAM and the maximum power reduction (MPR) for intra-band
contiguous CA Bandwidth Class C due to Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3A.1_1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3A.1_1 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA to
all types of E-UTRA UE from release 13 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA, UL CA and UL
64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3A.1_1 has not been included in the test case applicability Table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2.
This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3A.1_1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output
power in Table 6.2.2A.0-2due to higher order modulation and contiguously aggregated transmit bandwidth
configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table 6.2.3A.1_1.3-1. In case the modulation format is different on
different component carriers then the MPR is determined by the rules applied to higher order of those modulations.

For PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation for
the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation bandwidth class C with non-contiguous resource allocation, the allowed
Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2A-1 is specified as follows:
MPR = CEIL { min(MA, MIM5), 0.5}
Where MA is defined as follows:
MA = 	8.2				; 0 ≤ A < 0.025
9.2 - 40A 		; 0.025	≤ A < 0.05
8 - 16A		; 0.05	≤ A < 0.25
4.83 - 3.33A	; 0.25 ≤ A ≤ 0.4,
3.83 - 0.83A	; 0.4 ≤ A ≤ 1,
and MIM5 is defined as follows:
MIM5 =		4.5		; ?IM5 < 1.5 * BWChannel_CA
6.0		; 1.5 * BWChannel_CA ≤ ?IM5 < BWChannel_CA/2 + FOOB
MA		; ?IM5 ≥ BWChannel_CA/2 + FOOB
Where
A = NRB_alloc / NRB_agg.
?IM5 = max( | FC_agg  ? (3*Fagg_alloc_low ? 2*Fagg_alloc_high) |,  | FC_agg  ? (3*Fagg_alloc_high ? 2*Fagg_alloc_low) | )
FC_agg = (Fedge_high + Fedge_low)/2
CEIL{MA, 0.5} means rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB, i.e. MPR?[3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0,
7.5, 8.0, 8.5].

according to Table 6.2.5A.1.3-1.

6.2.3A.2	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA (inter-band DL CA and UL CA)
6.2.3A.2.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3A.2.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (ACLR) for CA and Spectrum emission mask (SEM) for CA and the maximum power reduction (MPR)
for inter-band CA Bandwidth Class A due to Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3A.2.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3A.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA and
6.6.2.1A.2 Spectrum emission mask (SEM) for CA to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support
inter-band DL CA and UL CA.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3A.2 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3A.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band (Table 5.4.2A-1), the requirements in
subclause 6.2.3 apply.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink active in two E-UTRA
bands, the requirements in subclause 6.2.3 apply [for each uplink carrier].
For UE Power Class 1 and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table
6.2.2A.0-1due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table
6.2.3A.2.3-1.

For PRACH, PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For each subframe, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot; the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.3A and 6.2.3.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg. only the
first of those is tested. according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	For Low range place test point with RBstart=0. For High range place test point with RBstart=RBmax-
LCRB+1.
Note 4:	Applicable only for 6.6.2.1A.2 Spectrum emission mask for CA (inter-band DL CA and UL CA)

1.	Connect the SS and interfering sources to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A,
Figure group A.32 as appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.3A.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.3A.2.4.3.
6.2.3A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.3A.2.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the MAC-CE according to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8. Wait for at
least 2 seconds as per TS 36.133 [4] clause 8.3.3.2.
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.3A.2.4.1-1on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access mode. The
period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.
6.2.3A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
6.2.3A.2.5	Test Requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 6 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum output
power and tolerance in Table 6.2.3A.2.5-1, as applicable.

Note 1:	Lower limit is assuming ΔTIB,c is zero. If non-zero. PCMAX,c will decrease and T(PCMAX_L,c) may be higher
resulting in different test requirements according to Table 6.2.5.3-1.
Note 2:	ΔTC,c does not apply in all bands. For bands without this lower limit is 19.3 dBm in all test points

6.2.3A.2_1	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA (inter-band DL CA and UL CA) for
UL 64QAM
6.2.3A.2_1.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3A.2_1.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA and the maximum power reduction (MPR) for inter-band CA Bandwidth Class A
due to Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3A.2_1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3A.2_1 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA to
all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support inter-band DL CA, UL CA and UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3A.2_1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2.
This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3A.2_1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band (Table 5.4.2A-1), the requirements in
subclause 6.2.3 apply.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink active in two E-UTRA
bands, the requirements in subclause 6.2.3 apply [for each uplink carrier].
For UE Power Class 1 and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table
6.2.2A.0-1due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table
6.2.3A.2_1.3-1.

For PRACH, PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For each subframe, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot; the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.3A and 6.2.3.
6.2.3A.2_1.4	Test description
6.2.3A.2_1.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-2. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.3A.2_1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference

Note 1:	Lower limit is assuming ΔTIB,c is zero. If non-zero. PCMAX,c will decrease and T(PCMAX_L,c) may be higher
resulting in different test requirements according to Table 6.2.5.3-1.
Note 2:	ΔTC,c does not apply in all bands. For bands without this lower limit is 19.3 dBm in all test points

6.2.3A.3	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for CA (intra-band non-contiguous DL CA
and UL CA)
Editor's note: For a transition period until RAN5#73, this test case in version 13.1.0 of 36.521-1 shall be used. This
is to ensure no test coverage is lost before the UL 64QAM test case becomes available.
6.2.3A.3.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3A.2.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (ACLR) for CA and the maximum power reduction (MPR) for inter-band CA Bandwidth Class A due to
Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3A.3.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3A.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for CA to all
types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support intra-band non-contiguous DL CA and UL CA but do not
support UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3A.3 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3A.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier, the requirements in subclause 6.2.3 apply.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two uplink carriers MPR is specified for E-UTRA CA
configurations with a maximum possible WGAP ≤ 35 MHz; the allowed MPR is
MPR = CEIL {MN, 0.5}
where MN is defined as follows
MN = -0.125 N + 18.25; 2 ≤ N ≤ 50
-0.0333 N + 13.67; 50 < N ≤ 200
where N= NRB_alloc is the number of allocated resource blocks. E-UTRA CA configurations with a maximum possible
Wgap > 35 MHz and their corresponding MPR are intended to form part of a later release.
For intra-band carrier aggregation, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the
transmission(s) on all component carriers within the slot; the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the
entire subframe.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.3A.
6.2.3A.3.4	Test description
6.2.3A.3.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.3A.3.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.3A.3.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.3A.3.4.3.
6.2.3A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.3A.2.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the MAC-CE according to TS 36.321 [13] clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8. Wait for at
least 2 seconds as per TS 36.133 [4] clause 8.3.3.2.
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.3A.3.4.1-1on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access mode. The
period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.
6.2.3A.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
6.2.3A.3.5	Test Requirements

6.2.3B	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for UL-MIMO
6.2.3B.1	Test purpose
The number of RB identified in Table 6.2.3B.3-1 is based on meeting the requirements for adjacent channel leakage
ratio for UL-MIMO and the maximum power reduction (MPR) for UL-MIMO due to Cubic Metric (CM).
6.2.3B.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test cases 6.6.2.3B Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio to all types of E-
UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3B has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3B.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power is
measured as the sum of the maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. For UE Power Class 3, the allowed
Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2B.3-1 due to higher order modulation
and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table 6.2.3B.3-1 with UL-MIMO configurations
defined in Table 6.2.2B.3-2.

Note 1:	For transmission configurations (Figure 5.4.2-1) confined within FUL_low and FUL_low + 4
MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed
by reducing the lower tolerance limit by 1.5 dB.
Note 2:	For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in Table
6.2.5B.3-1 apply

6.2.3D	UE Maximum Output Power for ProSe
6.2.3D.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 1, 2 and 3, this subclause specifies the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) power for
ProSe physical signals due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks).
The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical signal PSSS shall be as be as specified in
subclause 6.2.3 for PUSCH QPSK modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical signal SSSS is specified in Table 6.2.3D.0-1.
For a power class 2 capable UE operating on Band 41, the corresponding requirements for a power class 3 UE apply
when an IE P-max as defined in [5] of 23 dBm or lower is indicated in the cell or if the TDD frame configuration is 0 or

6.2.3D.1	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for ProSe Discovery
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	ProSe UE authentication is not handled in the test case and is still under investigation.
-	Message exceptions content needs further investigation (some values still TBD).
-	Test system uncertainties and test tolerances.
6.2.3D.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of the UE maximum output power does not exceed the range prescribed by the specific
maximum output power with MPR and tolerance when operating in ProSe Discovery mode.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.

Note 1:	The above tolerances are applicable for UE(s) that support up to 4 E-UTRA operating bands. For UE(s)
that support 5 or more E-UTRA bands the maximum output power is expected to decrease with each
additional band and is FFS
Note 2:	For transmission bandwidths (Figure 5.4.2-1, Table 5.4.4-1) confined within FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz
or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by reducing the
lower tolerance limit by 1.5 dB
Note 3:	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified without taking into account the tolerance.
Note 4:	For the UE which supports both Band 11 and Band 21 operating frequencies, the tolerance is FFS.
Note 5:	When NS_20 is signalled, the total output power within 2000-2005 MHz shall be limited to 7 dBm.
Note 6:	For a UE that supports both Band 18 and Band 26, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed
by reducing the lower tolerance limit by 1.5dB for transmission bandwidths confined within 815 MHz and
818 MHz.

6.2.3EA	Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for UE category M1
6.2.3EA.1	Test purpose
To verify that the error of the UE maximum output power does not exceed the range prescribed by the specified
nominal maximum output power and tolerance covering configurations where a maximum power reduction is allowed
in the UE.
An excess maximum output power has the possibility to interfere to other channels or other systems. A small maximum
output power decreases the coverage area.
6.2.3EA.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.3EA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio for UE category M1
to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.3EA has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.3EA.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 3 and 5, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table
6.2.2EA-1 due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table

For PRACH, PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For each subframe, the MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot; the maximum MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5 EA.3 apply.
No other MPR requirement than those specified in Table 6.2.3EA-1 and Table 6.2.3EA-2 applies to category M1 UE.
6.2.3EA.4	Test description
6.2.3EA.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in clause 5.2E. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.3EA.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and MPDCCH before

SL_V_RNTI to schedule the V2X RMC according to Table 6.2.3G.1.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL and V2X RMCs.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level. Configure the UE to transmit PSCCH and PSSCH with the PUMAX
level of each test points.
3.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the V2X con-current band configuration. The period of
measurement shall be at least continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms).
6.2.3G.1.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6 with the following exceptions:
6.2.3G.1.3.5	Test requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 2 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum output
power and tolerance in Table 6.2.3G.13.5-1.

NOTE 1:	The con-current band combinations are used for V2X Service.
NOTE 2:	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified without taking into account the tolerance
NOTE 3:	For inter-band con-current aggregation the maximum power requirement applies to the total
transmitted power over all component carriers (per UE).
NOTE 4:	4 refers to the transmission bandwidths (Figure 5.4.2-1) confined within FUL_low and FUL_low + 4
MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by
reducing the lower tolerance limit by 1.5 dB

6.2.4	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR)
Editor’s note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
- TT and test points are TBD.
6.2.4.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the output power as specified in Table 6.2.2.3-1. Unless stated
otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
6.2.4.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_03, NS_04, NS_06, NS_07, NS_11, NS_20, NS_21 and NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE
release 8 and forward.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3 Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values
NS_05, NS_07, NS_08, NS_09, NS_11, NS_12, NS_13, NS_14, NS_15, NS_16, NS_17, NS_18, NS_19, NS_20,
NS_21, NS_22, NS_23, NS_24, NS_25 and NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 3 the specific requirements and identified sub-clauses are specified in Table 6.2.4.3-1 along with
the allowed A-MPR values that may be used to meet these requirements. The allowed A-MPR values specified below in
Table 6.2.4.3-1 to 6.2.4.3-24 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2.3. For the UE
maximum output power modified by A-MPR, the power limits specified in clause 6.2.5 apply.

Note 1	Applicable when the lower edge of the assigned E-UTRA UL channel bandwidth frequency is
larger than or equal to the upper edge of PHS band (1915.7 MHz) + 4 MHz + the channel BW
assigned, where channel BW is as defined in subclause 5.6. A-MPR for operations below this
frequency is not covered in this version of specifications except for the channel assignments
in Note2 as the emissions requirement in 6.6.3.3.3.2 may not be met. For 10MHz channel
bandwidth whose carrier frequency is larger than or equal to 1945 MHz or 15 MHz channel
bandwidth whose carrier frequency is larger than or equal to 1947.5 MHz, no A-MPR applies.
Note 2	Applicable when carrier frequency is 1932.5 MHz for 15MHz channel bandwidth or 1930 MHz
for 20MHz channel bandwidth case.
Note 3:	Applicable when the E-UTRA carrier is within 1920-1980 MHz.
Note 4:	Applicable when the upper edge of the channel bandwidth frequency is greater than
1980MHz.

For PRACH, PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed A-MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For each subframe, the A-MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot; the maximum A-MPR over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.2.4.
6.2.4.4	Test description
6.2.4.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.4.4.1-1 through table 6.2.4.4.1-24. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, the applicable
channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	 The Configuration ID will be used to map the applicable Test Configuration to the
corresponding Test Requirement in subclause 6.2.4.5 as not all combinations are necessarily
required based on the applicability of the UE.
Note 3:	The RBstart of partial RB allocation shall be RB# 0 and RB# (max +1 - RB allocation) of the

Note 4:	Applies only for UE-Categories ≥2.
Note 5:	For band 23, above table only applies to mid and high range test frequencies. Low range test
frequencies will be covered by NS_11 test configuration table.

Note 2:	Applies only for UE-Categories ≥2.
Note 3:	The 16QAM configurations shall not apply to UEs which support UL 64QAM.

Editor’s note: The following lines belong at the end of section 6.2.4.4.1. As new tables are added to this section,
these lines should always follow the tables.
1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4.4.1-1 to
Table 6.2.4.4.1-24.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4.4.3.
6.2.4.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.2.4.4.1-24. Since the
UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode. The period of
measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods
are not under test.
6.2.4.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6, with the following exceptions for each network
signalled value.
6.2.4.4.3.1	Message contents exceptions (network signalled value "NS_03")
1.	Information element additionalSpectrumEmission is set to NS_03. This can be set in the
SystemInformationblockType2 as part of the cell broadcast message. This exception indicates that the UE shall
meet the additional spurious emission requirement for a specific deployment scenario.

Note 1:	Lower limit is assuming ΔTIB,c is zero. If non-zero, PCMAX,c will decrease and T(PCMAX_L,c) may be higher
resulting in different test requirements according to Table 6.2.5.3-1.

6.2.4_1	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for HPUE
6.2.4_1.1	Test purpose
Same test purpose as in clause 6.2.4.1 with the follow exception:
-	Instead of Table 6.2.2.3-1 --> use Table 6.2.2_1.3-1
6.2.4_1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_06 and NS_04, to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 1 or Power Class 2 UE release 10 and forward.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4_1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4_1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE Power Class 1 or Power Class 2 the specific requirements and identified sub-clauses are specified in Table
6.2.4_1.3-1 along with the allowed A-MPR values that may be used to meet these requirements. The allowed A-MPR
values specified in Table 6.2.4_1.3-1 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2.3_1. For
the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR, the power limits specified in clause 6.2.5_1 apply.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.2.4.

NOTE 1:	RBstart indicates the lowest RB index of transmitted resource blocks
NOTE 2:	LCRB is the length of a contiguous resource block allocation
NOTE 3:	For intra-subframe frequency hopping which intersects regions, notes 1 and 2 apply on a per slot basis
NOTE 4:	For intra-subframe frequency hopping which intersects regions, the larger A-MPR value may be applied for
both slots in the subframe

For a power class 2 capable UE operating in Band 41, A-MPR according to Table 6.2.4.3-2, Table 6.2.4.3-3, or Table
6.2.4.3-4 for power class 3 is allowed when an IE P-max as defined in [5] of 23 dBm or lower is indicated in the cell or
if the uplink/downlink configuration is 0 or 6.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band,
the applicable channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	The Configuration ID will be used to map the applicable Test
Configuration to the corresponding Test Requirement in subclause 6.2.4.5
as not all combinations are necessarily required based on the applicability
of the UE.
Note 3:	The RBstart of partial RB allocation shall be RB# 0 and RB# (max +1 - RB
allocation) of the channel bandwidth.

6.2.4_1.5	Test requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 2 of clause 6.2.4_1.4.2 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal
maximum output power and tolerance in Table 6.2.4_1.5-1 and 6.2.4_1.5-2. The allowed A-MPR values specified in
Table 6.2.4_1.3-1 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2.3_1. For the UE maximum
output power modified by MPR and/or A-MPR, the power limits specified in Table 6.2.5_1.3-1 apply.

Note 1:	Lower limit is assuming ΔTIB,c is zero. If non-zero, PCMAX,c will decrease and T(PCMAX_L,c) may be higher
resulting in different test requirements according to Table 6.2.5.3-1.

6.2.4_2	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for UL 64QAM
Editor's note:
-	Test requirements values in this section need to be reviewed in order to take into account notes in Table 6.2.5.3-
2: ΔTIB,c regarding ΔTIB,c and asymmetric lower tolerances in table 6.2.2.3-1.
6.2.4_2.1	Test purpose
Same test purpose as in clause 6.2.4.1
6.2.4_2.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2_1 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_03, NS_04, NS_06, NS_07, NS_11, NS_20, NS_21 and NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA UE from release 13
and forward that support UL 64QAM.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3_1 Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values
NS_04, NS_05, NS_07, NS_08, NS_09, NS_11, NS_12, NS_13, NS_14, NS_15, NS_16, NS_17, NS_18, NS_19,
NS_20, NS_21, NS_22, NS_23, NS_24, NS_25, NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA UE from release 13 and forward that
support UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4_2 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4_2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 6.2.4.3
6.2.4_2.4	Test description
6.2.4_2.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.4_2.4.1-1 through table 6.2.4_2.4.1-25. The details
of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Editor’s note: The following lines belong at the end of section 6.2.4_2.4.1. As new tables are added to this section,
these lines should always follow the tables.
1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4_2.4.1-1 to
Table 6.2.4_2.4.1-25.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4_2.4.3.
6.2.4_2.4.2	Test procedure
Same test procedure as in clause 6.2.4.4.2 with the following exceptions:
-	Instead of Table 6.2.4.4.1-1 to 6.2.4.4.1-24 --> use Table 6.2.4_2.4.1-1 to 6.2.4_2.4.1-25
6.2.4_2.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in clause 6.2.4.4.3 except table numbers.
6.2.4_2.5	Test requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 3 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum output
power and tolerance in the applicable table from Table 6.2.4_2.5-1 to Table 6.2.4_2.5-27. The allowed A-MPR values
specified in Table 6.2.4_2.3-1 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2.3. For the UE
maximum output power modified by MPR and/or A-MPR, the power limits specified in Table 6.2.5.3-1 apply.

6.2.4_3	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) with PUSCH
frequency hopping
Following aspects missing or not yet determined:
*	Emissions test cases covering this test is missing
*	HARQ configuration for re-transmissions is missing
6.2.4_3.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the output power as specified in Table 6.2.2.3-1. Unless stated
otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used. When PUSCH inter-subframe frequency hopping is configured the UE will
use different resource blocks for HARQ retransmissions compared to the previous transmission resulting in potentially
different A-MPR.
The purpose of this test is to ensure the UE is using A-MPR in a correct way fulfilling emissions requirements also
when PUSCH frequency hopping is enabled.
6.2.4_3.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2_2 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_07, NS_11 and NS_20 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
The requirements of this test apply in test case TBD Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values NS_07,
NS_11, NS_12, NS_13, NS_14, NS_15, NS_16, NS_19 and NS_20 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4_3 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4_3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 6.2.4.3
6.2.4_3.4	Test description
6.2.4_3.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.4_3.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	The Configuration ID will be used to map the applicable Test Configuration to the
corresponding Test Requirement in subclause 6.2.4_3.5 as not all combinations are
necessarily required based on the applicability of the UE.
Note 2:	The RBstart of partial RB allocation shall be RB# 0 of the channel bandwidth.
Note 3:	High range test frequency to be used.
Note 4:	Low range test frequency to be used.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4_3.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4.4.3.
6.2.4_3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 with hopping
bit(s) set to 1 (PUSCH type 2 hopping) for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable Table
6.2.4_3.4.1-1. SS sends always NACK on PHICH to trigger UE retransmissions needed for mirroring of RBs.
Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode in a TTI. The period of
measurement shall be one sub-frame (1ms) excluding the 20 us transient periods in beginning and end of the
subframe.
4.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode in the next TTI of the
same HARQ process. The period of measurement shall be one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient
periods are not under test.
6.2.4_3.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in 6.2.4.4.2
6.2.4_3.5	Test requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 3 and 4 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum
output power and tolerance in the applicable table 6.2.4_3.5-1 and 6.2.4_3.5-2. The allowed A-MPR values specified in
Table 6.2.4.3-1 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2.3. For the UE maximum output
power modified by MPR and/or A-MPR, the power limits specified in Table 6.2.5.3-1 apply.

6.2.4A	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for CA
6.2.4A.1	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for CA (intra-band
contiguous DL CA and UL CA)
6.2.4A.1.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation can be signalled by
the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet
these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the CA Power Class as
specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-2.
6.2.4A.1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2A.1 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for CA (intra-band
contiguous DL CA and UL CA) for network signalled value CA_NS_04 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and
forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL CA but do not support UL 64QAM.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3A.1 Additional spurious emissions for CA (intra-band contiguous
DL CA and UL CA) for network signalled values CA_NS_01, CA_NS_02 and CA_NS_03, CA_NS_05, CA_NS_06,
CA_NS_07 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and UL CA.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4A.1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4A.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation can be signalled by
the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet
these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the CA Power Class as
specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-2.
If for intra-band carrier aggregation the UE is configured for transmissions on a single serving cell, then subclauses
6.2.3 and 6.2 4 apply with the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmission.
For intra-band contiguous aggregation with the UE configured for transmissions on two serving cells, the maximum
output power reduction specified in Table 6.2.4A.1.3-1 is allowed for all serving cells of the applicable uplink CA
configurations according to the CA network signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-
r10. Then clause 6.2.3A.1.3 does not apply, i.e. the carrier aggregation MPR = 0 dB, unless the value indicated is
CA_NS_31.
For the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR specified in table 6.2.4A.1.3-1, the power limits specified in
subclause 6.2.5A.1.3 apply.

NOTE 2:	The index of the sequence CA_NS corresponds to the value of additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-
r10.

For PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed A-MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation
for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For intra-band carrier aggregation, the A-MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the
transmission(s) on all component carriers within the slot; the maximum A-MPR over the two slots is then applied for
the entire subframe.

If the UE is configured to CA_39C and it receives IE CA_NS_07 the allowed maximum output power reduction applied
to transmissions on the PCell and the SCell with non-contiguous resource allocation is defined as follows
A-MPR = CEIL {MA, 0.5}
Where MA is defined as follows:
   MA = -16.25A + 21				; 0 ≤ A < 0.80
   -2.50 A + 10.00				; 0.80 ≤ A ≤ 1
Where A = NRB_alloc / NRB_agg
6.2.4A.1.4	Test description
6.2.4A.1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 6.2.4A.1.4.1-1 to 6.2.4A.1.4.1-7. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4A.1.4.1-1 to
6.2.4A.1.4.1-7.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4A.1.4.3.
6.2.4A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.4A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable from Table 6.2.4A.1.4.1-1 to Table 6.2.4A.1.4.1-7 on both
PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE;
allow at least 200ms for the UE to reach PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean transmitted power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access
mode. The period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD
slots with transient periods are not under test.
6.2.4A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.The following exceptions apply for each network
signalled value.
6.2.4A.1.4.3.1	Message contents exceptions (network signalled value "CA_NS_01")
1.	Information element additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10 is set to CA_NS_01. This can be set in the
RadioResourceConfigCommonSCell-r10-DEFAULT as part of the common RRC messages. This exception
indicates that the UE shall meet the additional spectrum emission requirement for a specific deployment
scenario.

6.2.4A.1_1	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for CA (intra-band
contiguous DL CA and UL CA) for UL 64QAM
Editor's notes:
- Minimum requirement for CA_NS_08 for this test case is undefined in TS 36.101.
6.2.4A.1_1.1	Test purpose
Same test purpose as in clause 6.2.4A.1.1.
6.2.4A.1_1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2A.1_1 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for CA (intra-band
contiguous DL CA and UL CA) for network signalled value CA_NS_04 to all types of E-UTRA UE from release 13
and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA, UL CA and UL 64QAM.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3A.1_1 Additional spurious emissions for CA (intra-band
contiguous DL CA and UL CA) for network signalled values CA_NS_01, CA_NS_02 and CA_NS_03, CA_NS_05,
CA_NS_06, CA_NS_07, CA_NS_08 to all types of E-UTRA UE from release 13 and forward that support intra-band
contiguous DL CA, UL CA and UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4A.1_1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2.
This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4A.1_1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation can be signalled by
the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet
these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the CA Power Class as
specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-2.
If for intra-band carrier aggregation the UE is configured for transmissions on a single serving cell, then subclauses
6.2.3 and 6.2 4 apply with the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmission.
For intra-band contiguous aggregation with the UE configured for transmissions on two serving cells, the maximum
output power reduction specified in Table 6.2.4A.1_1.3-1 is allowed for all serving cells of the applicable uplink CA
configurations according to the CA network signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-
r10. Then clause 6.2.3A.1.3 does not apply, i.e. the carrier aggregation MPR = 0 dB, unless the value indicated is
CA_NS_31. For uplink 64QAM, the applied maximum output power reduction is obtained by taking the maximum
value of MPR requirements specified in Table 6.2.3A.1_1.3-1 and A-MPR requirements specified in Table
6.2.4A.1_1.3-1.
For the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR specified in table 6.2.4A.1_1.3-1, the power limits specified in
subclause 6.2.5A.1.3 apply.

NOTE 2:	The index of the sequence CA_NS corresponds to the value of additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10.

For PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed A-MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation
for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
For intra-band carrier aggregation, the A-MPR is evaluated per slot and given by the maximum value taken over the
transmission(s) on all component carriers within the slot; the maximum A-MPR over the two slots is then applied for
the entire subframe.

6.2.4A.1_1.4	Test description
6.2.4A.1_1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-1 to 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-7. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.
Table 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-1: Test Configuration Table (network signalled value "CA_NS_01")
Initial Conditions
Test Environment as specified in
TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.1

Table 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-8: Test Configuration Table (network signalled value "CA_NS_08")
[Table 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-8 TBD]

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-1 to
6.2.4A.1_1.4.1-7.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4A.1_1.4.3.
6.2.4A.1_1.4.2	Test procedure

6.2.4A.1_1.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in clause 6.2.4A.1.4.3.
6.2.4A.1_1.5	Test requirements
The maximum output power, derived in step 3 shall be within the range prescribed by the nominal maximum output
power and tolerance in the applicable table from Table 6.2.4A.1_1.5-1 to Table 6.2.4A.1_1.5-7. For uplink QPSK or
16QAM, the allowed maximum output power reduction is specified in Table 6.2.4A.1_1.3-1 and clause 6.2.3A.1 does
not apply, i.e. carrier aggregation MPR = 0. For uplink 64QAM, the applied maximum output power reduction is
obtained by taking the maximum value of MPR requirements specified in Table 6.2.3A.1_1.3-1 and A-MPR
requirements specified in Table 6.2.4A.1_1.3-1. For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR specified in
Table 6.2.3A.1_1.3-1 or A-MPR specified in Table 6.2.4A.1_1.3-1, the power limits specified in Table 6.2.5A.1.3-1

6.2.4A.2	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for CA (inter-band DL CA
and UL CA)
Editor's note: For a transition period until RAN5#73, this test case in version 13.1.0 of 36.521-1 shall be used. This
is to ensure no test coverage is lost before the UL 64QAM test case becomes available.Based on analysis
for CA_3A-19A in TR 36.905 [19] no requirements in additional spurious emissions are required so A-
MPR requirements are not tested for this CA configuration in any test case.
6.2.4A.2.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation can be signalled by
the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet
these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the CA Power Class as
specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-1.
6.2.4A.2.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2A.2 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for CA (inter-band DL
CA and UL CA) for network signalled value NS_01/NS_03, NS_03/NS_03, NS_03/NS_06, NS_03/NS_07,
NS_03/NS_01, NS_01/NS_06, NS_01/NS_21, NS_03/NS_21, NS_06/NS_21 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11
and forward but do not support UL 64QAM.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3A.2 Additional spurious emissions for CA (inter-band DL CA and
UL CA) for network signalled values NS_05/NS_01, NS_03/NS_07, NS_01/NS_12 and NS_01/NS15, NS_01/NS_21,
NS_03/NS_21, NS_06/NS_21 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward but do not support UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4A.2 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4A.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
If for inter-band carrier aggregation the UE is configured for transmissions on a single serving cell, then subclauses
6.2.3 and 6.2 4 apply with the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmission.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with the UE configured for transmissions on two serving cells the maximum output
power reduction specified in Table 6.2.4-1 is allowed for each serving cell of the applicable uplink CA configuration
according to the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSprectrumEmission for the PCC and the CA
network signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10 for the SCC. The value of
additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10 is equal to that of additionalSprectrumEmission configured on the SCC. MPR as
specified in subclause 6.2.3A is allowed in addition.
For PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed A-MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation
for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause
6.2.4A.
6.2.4A.2.4	Test description
6.2.4A.2.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state. For the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR specified in table
6.2.4A.2.4.1-1, the power limits specified in subclause 6.2.5A.2.3 apply.

Note 1:	For CCs with NS_01, there are no additional requirements defined in 36.101. Only CCs
with NS-value different than NS_01 needs to be tested.
Note 2:	A-MPR values for NS-values in this table are the same as in section 6.2.4.3.
Note 3:	Selection of CA configurations and NS-values to test is derived in TR 36.905 [19]
Note 4:	For simplifying test, PCC is mapped to the first band of the combination as listed in Uplink
CA Configuration column
Note 5:	No test required since only A-Spur requirements apply, and the frequency range to test is
unaffected by intermodulation products as described in section 4.3 in TR 36.905 [19].
Note 6:	No test required since no A_SEM and/or A-Spur requirements apply
Note 7:	As an exception to note 4, PCC is mapped to the second band of the combination as listed
in Uplink CA Configuration column.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-2. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in table 6.2.4A.2.4.1-2 to 6.2.4A.1.4.1-13. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 4:	Applicable only to Low range frequency testing.
Note 5:	Applicable only to High range frequency testing.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4A.2.4.1-2 to
6.2.4A.2.4.1-13.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.4A.2.4.3.
6.2.4A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	 Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.2.4A.2.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable from Table 6.2.4A.2.4.1-2 to Table 6.2.4A.2.4.1-13 on both
PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE;
allow at least 200ms for the UE to reach PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean transmitted power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access
mode. The period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD
slots with transient periods are not under test.
6.2.4A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.The following exceptions apply for each network

and UL CA) for UL 64QAM
6.2.4A.2_1.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation can be signalled by
the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet
these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the CA Power Class as
specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-1.
6.2.4A.2_1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2A.2_1 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for CA (inter-band
DL CA and UL CA) for network signalled value NS_03/NS_03, NS_03/NS_03, NS_03/NS_06, NS_03/NS_07,
NS_03/NS_01, NS_01/NS_06 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support inter-band DL CA and
UL CA and UL 64QAM.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3A.2_1 Additional spurious emissions for CA (inter-band DL CA
and UL CA) for network signalled values NS_05/NS_01, NS_03/NS_07, NS_01/NS_12 and NS_01/NS15 to all types
of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward that support inter-band DL CA and UL CA and UL 64QAM.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4A.2_1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2.
This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4A.2_1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
If for inter-band carrier aggregation the UE is configured for transmissions on a single serving cell, then subclauses
6.2.3 and 6.2 4 apply with the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmission.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with the UE configured for transmissions on two serving cells the maximum output
power reduction specified in Table 6.2.4-1 is allowed for each serving cell of the applicable uplink CA configuration
according to the Network Signalling value indicated by the field additionalSprectrumEmission for the PCC and the CA
network signalling value indicated by the field additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10 for the SCC. The value of
additionalSpectrumEmissionSCell-r10 is equal to that of additionalSprectrumEmission configured on the SCC. MPR as
specified in subclause 6.2.3A is allowed in addition.
For PUCCH and SRS transmissions, the allowed A-MPR is according to that specified for PUSCH QPSK modulation
for the corresponding transmission bandwidth. The normative reference for this requirement is in TS 36.101 [2] clause
6.2.4A.

6.2.4B	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for UL-MIMO
6.2.4B.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the sum output power at each antenna connector as specified in
Table 6.2.2B.3-1. Unless stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
6.2.4B.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2 B Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_03, NS_04, NS_06, NS_07, NS_11, NS_20, NS_21 and NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and
forward that support UL MIMO.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3 B Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values
NS_04, NS_05, NS_07, NS_08, NS_09, NS_12, NS_13, NS_14, NS_15, NS_16, NS_17, NS_18, NS_19, NS_21,
NS_22, NS_23, NS_24, NS_25 and NS_27 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL MIMO.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4B has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4B.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.2.4.3.
6.2.4B.4	Test description
6.2.4B.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.4B.4.1-1 through table 6.2.4B.4.1-21. The details of
the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

6.2.4EA	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for UE category M1
Editor’s note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
*	NS_04 (B41), NS_12 (B26): Minimum requirements in 36.101 are incomplete. Test configuration table
and test requirements are missing
6.2.4EA.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the output power as specified in Table 6.2.2 EA -1. Unless stated
otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
6.2.4EA.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2EA Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_03, NS_04, NS_06 and NS_07to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3EA.3 Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values
NS_05, NS_07, NS_08, NS_09, NS_12, NS_13, NS_14, NS_15, NS_16, NS_17 and NS_18 to all types of E-UTRA
UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4EA has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4EA.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the output power as specified in Table 6.2.2EA-1. Unless stated
otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
For UE Power Class 3 and 5 the specific requirements and identified subclauses are specified in Table 6.2.4EA-1 along
with the allowed A-MPR values that may be used to meet these requirements. The allowed A-MPR values specified
below in Table 6.2.4EA-1 and from 6.2.4EA-2 to 6.2.4EA-3 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements specified
in subclause 6.2.3EA.

6.2.4EA.4	Test description
6.2.4EA.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in sub-clause 5.2E. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Table 6.2.4EA.4.1-1 to 6.2.4EA.4.1-15. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and MPDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure A.3 using only main
UE Tx/Rx antenna.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.4EA.4.1-1 to Table 6.2.4EA.4.1-15.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-CE according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2AA. Message contents are defined
in clause 6.2.4EA.4.3.
6.2.4EA.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via M-PDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable table from Table 6.2.4EA.4.1-1 to Table
6.2.4EA.4.1-15. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL
RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode. The period of
measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods
are not under test. For HD-FDD slots with transient periods and Half-duplex guard subframe are not under test.

6.2.4G	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for V2X
Communication
Editor’s notes: This test case is incomplete. The following items are missing or incomplete:
- NS_33 (B47): Minimum requirements in TS 36.101 are incomplete. Test configuration table and test requirements
are missing.
- Network signalled value "NS_33" is not defined in RAN2.
- Test description
6.2.4G.1	Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for V2X Communication /
Non-concurrent with E-UTRA uplink transmissions
6.2.4G.1.1	Test purpose
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall
also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional
Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the output power as specified in Table 6.2.2.3-1. Unless stated
otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
6.2.4G.1.2	Test applicability
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.2.2.4 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask for network signalled
values NS_33 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X communication.
The requirements of this test apply in test case 6.6.3.3 Additional Spurious Emissions for network signalled values
NS_33 to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X communication.
NOTE:	As a result TC 6.2.4G.1 has not been included in the test case applicability table 4.1-1, TS 36.521-2. This
does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other purposes if deemed useful.
6.2.4G.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
When UE is configured for E-UTRA V2X sidelink transmissions non-concurrent with E-UTRA uplink transmissions
for E-UTRA V2X operating bands specified in Table 5.2G-1, the allowed A-MPR for the maximum output power for
V2X physical channels PSCCH and PSSCH shall be as specified in Table 6.2.4G.1.3-1.

FFS
6.2.4G.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	The UE starts to perform the V2X sidelink communication according to SL-V2X-Preconfiguration. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the V2X RMC. (UE
should be already transmitting PUMAX after Initial Conditions setting)
2.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth for each test point in table [FFS] according to the
test configuration from Table [FFS]. The period of measurement shall be at least continuous duration of one sub-
frame (1ms).
6.2.4G.1.4.3	Message contents

1.	Information element additionalSpectrumEmission is set to NS_33. This can be set in the SL-PreconfigGeneral-
r12 as part of the SL-V2X-Preconfiguration. This exception indicates that the UE shall meet the additional
spurious emission requirement for a specific deployment scenario.

6.2.4G.1.5	Test Requirements
FFS
6.2.5	Configured UE transmitted Output Power
Editor’s notes: This clause is incomplete awaiting for RAN4 decision for CA_7A-40A, CA_7A-40C, CA_42A-46A,
CA_2A-4A-29A and CA_7A-8A-20A:
*	ΔTIB,c is still in square brackets
6.2.5.1	Test purpose
To verify the UE does not exceed the minimum between the PEMAX maximum allowed UL TX Power signalled by the
E-UTRAN and the PUMAX maximum UE power the UE power class.
6.2.5.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward.
6.2.5.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power PCMAX,c for serving cell c. The configured maximum
output power PCMAX is set within the following bounds:
	PCMAX_L,c ≤ PCMAX,c ≤ PCMAX_H,c with
PCMAX_L,c = MIN {PEMAX,c ? ?TC,c,  (PPowerClass ? ΔPPowerClass) ? MAX(MPRc + A-MPRc + ΔTIB,c + ?TC,c + ?TProSe, P-
MPRc)}
PCMAX_H,c = MIN {PEMAX,c, PPowerClass ? ΔPPowerClass }
where
-	PEMAX,c is the value given by IE P-Max for serving cell c, defined in [5];
-	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2.2.3-1 without taking into account the tolerance
specified in the Table 6.2.2.3-1;
-	ΔPPowerClass = 3 dB for a power class 2 capable UE operating in Band 41, when P-max of 23 dBm or lower is
indicated or if the uplink/downlink configuration is 0 or 6 in the cell; otherwise, ΔPPowerClass = 0 dB
-	MPRc and A-MPRc for serving cell c are specified in Section 6.2.3 and Section 6.2.4, respectively;
-	?TIB,c is the additional tolerance for serving cell c as specified in Table 6.2.5.3-2; ?TIB,c = 0 dB otherwise;
-	?TC,c = 1.5 dB when Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1 applies;
-	?TC,c = 0 dB when Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1 does not apply.
-	?TProSe = 0.1 dB when the UE supports ProSe Direct Discovery and/or ProSe Direct Communication on the
corresponding E-UTRA ProSe band; ?TProSe = 0 dB otherwise.
P-MPRc is the allowed maximum output power reduction for
a)	ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy absorption requirements and addressing unwanted
emissions / self defence requirements in case of simultaneous transmissions on multiple RAT(s) for scenarios not
in scope of 3GPP RAN specifications;
b)	ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy absorption requirements in case of proximity
detection is used to address such requirements that require a lower maximum output power.
The UE shall apply P-MPRc for serving cell c only for the above cases. For UE conducted conformance testing P-MPRc
shall be 0 dB
NOTE 1: P-MPRc was introduced in the PCMAX,c equation such that the UE can report to the eNB the available
maximum output transmit power. This information can be used by the eNB for scheduling decisions.
NOTE 2: P-MPRc may impact the maximum uplink performance for the selected UL transmission path.
For each subframe, the PCMAX_L,c for serving cell c is evaluated per slot and given by the minimum value taken over the
transmission(s) within the slot; the minimum PCMAX_L,c over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe.
PPowerClass shall not be exceeded by the UE during any period of time.
The measured maximum output power PUMAX,c shall be within the following bounds:
PCMAX_L,c ? MAX{TL, T(PCMAX_L,c) } ≤ PUMAX,c ≤ PCMAX_H,c + T(PCMAX_H,c)
Where the tolerance T(PCMAX,c) for applicable values of PCMAX,c is specified in Table 6.2.5.3-1. The tolerance TL,c is the
absolute value of the lower tolerance for the applicable operating band as specified in Table 6.2.2.3-1.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with the uplink assigned to one or two E-
UTRA bands the ΔTIB,c is defined for applicable bands in Tables 6.2.5.3-2, 6.2.5.3-3 and 6.2.5.3-4.

NOTE 1:	The above additional tolerances are only applicable for the E-UTRA operating
bands that belong to the supported inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations
NOTE 2:	The above additional tolerances also apply in non-aggregated operation for the
supported E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported inter-band
carrier aggregation configurations
NOTE 3:	In case the UE supports more than one of the above 2DL inter-band carrier
aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA operating band belongs to more than
one 2DL inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the
applicable additional tolerance shall be the average of the 2DL tolerances
above, truncated to one decimal place for that operating band among the
supported 2DL CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between
low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum tolerance among the
different supported 2DL carrier aggregation configurations involving such band
shall be applied
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the
applicable additional 2DL tolerance shall be the maximum tolerance above that
applies for that operating band among the supported 2DL CA configurations
NOTE 4:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink in
one E-UTRA band and without simultaneous Rx/Tx.
NOTE 5:	Unless otherwise specified, in case the UE supports more than one of the
above 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and a E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one 3DL inter-band carrier aggregation
configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz and the
tolerances are the same, the value applies to the band. If the tolerances are
different, the applicable additional 3DL tolerance is FFS. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the
maximum tolerance among the different supported 3DL carrier aggregation
configurations involving such band shall be applied.
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable
additional 3DL tolerance shall be the maximum tolerance above that applies
for that operating band among the supported 3DL CA configurations.
NOTE 6:	The above additional tolerances applicable for the E-UTRA operating bands
that belong to the supported highest order inter-band carrier aggregation
configuration, also applies to the same E-UTRA operating bands that belong to
a supported lower order CA configuration.
NOTE 7:	Applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation without
simultaneous Rx/Tx.
NOTE 8:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink
active in the FDD band.
NOTE 9:	For Band 28, the requirements only apply for the restricted frequency range
specified for this CA configuration (Table 5.2A-2).
NOTE 10:	The requirement is applied for UE transmitting on the frequency range of 2545-
2690MHz.
NOTE 11:	The requirement is applied for UE transmitting on the frequency range of 2496-
2545MHz.
NOTE 12:	For UE supporting E-UTRA band 65 and CA configurations including Band 1,
the Band 65 ΔTIB,c is the max(Band 65 ΔTIB,c , Band 1 ΔTIB,c)
NOTE 13:	For UE supporting E-UTRA band 42, 43 or 48 and CA configurations including
Band 42, 43 or 48, the applicable ΔTIB,c in Band 42, 43, or 48 is the max(Band
42 ΔTIB,c , Band 43 ΔTIB,c, Band 48 ΔTIB,c).
NOTE 14:	Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink
active in Band 8.

NOTE 3:	The above additional tolerances do not apply to supported UTRA operating bands with frequency range
below 1 GHz that correspond to the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported inter-band
carrier aggregation configurations when such bands are belonging only to band combination(s) where one
band is <1GHz and another band is >1.7GHz and there is no harmonic relationship between the low band
UL and high band DL. Otherwise the above additional tolerances also apply to supported UTRA
operating bands that correspond to the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported inter-band
carrier aggregation configurations.
NOTE 4:	To meet the ?TIB,c requirements for CA_3A-7A with state-of-the-art technology, an increase in power
consumption of the UE may be required. It is also expected that as the state-of-the-art technology evolves
in the future, this possible power consumption increase can be reduced or eliminated.

6.2.5.4	Test description
6.2.5.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.2.5.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	Test Channel Bandwidths are checked separately for each E-UTRA band, the applicable
channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1.
Note 2:	For the uplink RB allocation the RBstart shall be RB #0.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, in Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.2.5.4.1-1
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2.5.4.3.
6.2.5.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.2.5.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send
the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send transmit uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at
least 200ms for the UE to reach the Pumax level of the test point.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth for each test point in table 6.2.5.5-1 according to
the test configuration from Table 6.2.5.4.1-1. The period of measurement shall be at least continuous duration of
one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are not under test.
6.2.5.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6 with the following exceptions:

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the
ΔTIB,c in Tables 6.2.5.3-2, 6.2.5.3-3 and 6.2.5.3-4 shall be applied for applicable bands.
In case the UE supports more than one of the above inter-band carrier aggregation configurations and an E-UTRA
operating band belongs to more than one inter-band carrier aggregation configurations then:
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
average of the tolerances in Table 6.2.5.3-2, truncated to one decimal place for that operating band among the
supported CA configurations. In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then
the maximum tolerance among the different supported carrier aggregation configurations involving such band
shall be applied.
-	When the E-UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable additional tolerance shall be the
maximum tolerance in Table 6.2.5.3-2 that applies for that operating band among the supported CA
configurations.
6.2.5A.4	Configured UE transmitted Output Power for CA (intra-band non-contiguous
DL CA and UL CA)
6.2.5A.4.1	Test purpose
To verify the UE does not exceed the minimum between the PEMAX,c maximum allowed UL TX Power signalled by the
E-UTRAN and the PUMAX maximum UE power for the UE power class.
6.2.5A.4.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 11 and forward that support intra-band non-contiguous DL CA and
UL CA.
6.2.5A.4.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For uplink carrier aggregation the UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power PCMAX,c for serving cell c
and its total configured maximum output power PCMAX.
The configured maximum output power PCMAX,c on serving cell c shall be set as specified in subclause 6.2.5.
For uplink intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, MPR c = MPR and A-MPR c = A-MPR with
MPR and A-MPR specified in clause 6.2.3A and clause 6.2.4A respectively. There is one power management term for
the UE, denoted P-MPR c, and P-MPR c = P-MPR. PCMAX,c is calculated under the assumption that the transmit power is
increased by the same amount in dB on all component carriers.
The total configured maximum output power PCMAX shall be set within the following bounds:
PCMAX_L ≤ PCMAX ≤ PCMAX_H
For uplink intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation,
PCMAX_L  = MIN{10 log10 ∑ pEMAX,c  - ?TC , PPowerClass ? MAX(MPR + A-MPR + ΔTIB,c + ?TC, P-MPR ) }
PCMAX_H  = MIN{10 log10 ∑ pEMAX,c , PPowerClass}
where
-	pEMAX,c is the linear value of PEMAX,c which is given by IE P-Max for serving cell c in [5];
-	PPowerClass is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2.2A.0-2 without taking into account the tolerance
specified in the Table 6.2.2A.0-2;
-	MPR and A-MPR are specified in subclause 6.2.3A and subclause 6.2.4A respectively;
-	?TIB,c is the additional tolerance for serving cell c as specified in Table 6.2.5.3-2;
-	P-MPR is the power management term for the UE;
-	?TC is the highest value ?TC,c among all serving cells c in the subframe over both timeslots. ?TC,c = 1.5 dB when
Note 2 in Table 6.2.2A.0-2 applies to the serving cell c, otherwise ?TC,c = 0 dB.
For each subframe, the PCMAX_L is evaluated per slot and given by the minimum value taken over the transmission(s)
within the slot; the minimum PCMAX_L over the two slots is then applied for the entire subframe. PPowerClass shall not be
exceeded by the UE during any period of time.
If the UE is configured with multiple TAGs and transmissions of the UE on subframe i for any serving cell in one TAG
overlap some portion of the first symbol of the transmission on subframe i +1 for a different serving cell in another
TAG, the UE minimum of PCMAX_L for subframes i and i + 1 applies for any overlapping portion of subframes i and i + 1.
PPowerClass shall not be exceeded by the UE during any period of time.
The measured maximum output power PUMAX over all serving cells shall be within the following range:
PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) }  ≤  PUMAX  ≤  PCMAX_H  +  THIGH(PCMAX_H)
PUMAX = 10 log10 ∑ pUMAX,c
where pUMAX,c  denotes the measured maximum output power for serving cell c expressed in linear scale. The tolerances
TLOW(PCMAX) and THIGH(PCMAX) for applicable values of PCMAX are specified in Table 6.2.5A.4.3-1 for intra-band carrier
aggregation. The tolerance TL is the absolute value of the lower tolerance for applicable E-UTRA CA configuration as
specified in Table 6.2.2A-2 of TS 36.101 for intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation.

E-UTRAN and the PUMAX maximum UE power the UE power class.
6.2.5G.2.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that support V2X Communication.
6.2.5G.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
When a UE is configured for simultaneous E-UTRA V2X sidelink and E-UTRA uplink transmissions for inter-band E-
UTRA V2X / E-UTRA bands specified in Table 5.2G-2, the UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power
PCMAX,c,E-UTRA and PCMAX,c,V2X for the configured E-UTRA uplink carrier and the configured E-UTRA V2X carrier,
respectively, and its total configured maximum output power PCMAX,c. The ?TIB,c of PCMAX,c,E-UTRA is specified in Table
6.2.5G.2.3-2.
The configured maximum output power PCMAX c,E-UTRA(p) in subframe p for the configured E-UTRA uplink carrier shall
be set within the bounds:
≤ PCMAX,c,E-UTRA (p) ≤ PCMAX_H,c,E-UTRA (p)
where PCMAX_L,c,E-UTRA and PCMAX_H,c,E-UTRA are the limits for a serving cell c as specified in subclause 6.2.5.
The configured maximum output power PCMAX c,V2X (q) in subframe q for the configured E-UTRA V2X carrier shall be
set within the bounds:
PCMAX,c,V2X (q) ≤  PCMAX_H,c,V2X (q)
where PCMAX_H,c,V2X is the limit as specified in subclause 6.2.5G.
The total UE configured maximum output power PCMAX (p,q) in a subframe p of an E-UTRA uplink carrier and a
subframe q of an E-UTRA V2X sidelink that overlap in time shall be set within the following bounds for synchronous
and asynchronous operation unless stated otherwise:
PCMAX_L (p,q) ≤ PCMAX (p,q) ≤ PCMAX_H (p,q)
with
PCMAX_L (p,q) = PCMAX_L,c,E-UTRA (p)
PCMAX_H (p,q) = MIN {10 log10 [pCMAX_H,c,E-UTRA (p) + pCMAX_H,c,V2X (q)], PPowerClass}
where pCMAX_H,c,V2X and pCMAX_H,c,E-UTRA are the limits PCMAX_H,c,V2X (q) and PCMAX_H,c,E-UTRA (p) expressed in linear scale.
The measured total maximum output power PUMAX over both the E-UTRA uplink and E-UTRA V2X carriers is
PUMAX = 10 log10 [pUMAX,c,E-UTRA + pUMAX,c,V2X],
where pUMAX,c,E-UTRA  denotes the measured output power of serving cell c for the configured E-UTRA uplink carrier,
and pUMAX,c,V2X  denotes the measured output power for the configured E-UTRA V2X carrier expressed in linear scale.
When a UE is configured for synchronous V2X sidelink and uplink transmissions,
PCMAX_L(p, q) ? TLOW (PCMAX_L(p, q)) ≤ PUMAX ≤ PCMAX_H(p, q) + THIGH (PCMAX_H(p, q))
where PCMAX_L (p,q) and PCMAX_H (p,q) are the limits for the pair (p,q) and with the tolerances TLOW(PCMAX) and
THIGH(PCMAX) for applicable values of PCMAX specified in Table 6.2.5G.2.3-1. PCMAX_L may be modified for any
overlapping portion of subframes (p, q) and (p +1, q+1).
When a UE is configured for asynchronous V2X and uplink transmissions, the subframe p for the E-UTRA uplink
carrier and subframe q for the E-UTRA V2X carrier overlap in time and
1.	if uplink carrier leads in time over q and V2X UE sidelink transmission has SCI whose “Priority” field is set to a
value less than the high layer parameter thresSL-TxPrioritization, then p is the reference subframe and the (p,q)
and (p,q-1) pairs are considered for determining the PCMAX tolerance
2.	if uplink carrier leads in time over q and V2X UE sidelink transmission has SCI whose “Priority” field is set to a
value larger than the high layer parameter thresSL-TxPrioritization,  then q is the reference subframe and the
(p,q) and (p+1,q) pairs are considered for determining the PCMAX tolerance
3.	if V2X carrier leads in time over p and V2X UE sidelink transmission has SCI whose “Priority” field is set to a
value less than the high layer parameter thresSL-TxPrioritization, then p is the reference subframe and the (p,q)
and (p,q+1) pairs are considered for determining the PCMAX tolerance
4.	if V2X carrier leads in time over p and V2X UE sidelink transmission has SCI whose “Priority” field is set to a
value larger than the high layer parameter thresSL-TxPrioritization,, then q is the reference subframe and the (p-
1,q) and (p,q) pairs are considered for determining the PCMAX tolerance
For the reference subframe p duration when uplink carrier leads:
P'CMAX_L = PCMAX_L,,cE-UTRA (p)
P'CMAX_H = MAX {PCMAX_H (p,q-1) , PCMAX_H  (p,q)}
For the reference subframe p duration when V2X carrier leads:
P'CMAX_L   = PCMAX_L,c,E-UTRA (p)
P'CMAX_H = MAX {PCMAX_H (p,q) , PCMAX_H (p,q+1)}
For the reference subframe q duration when uplink carrier leads:
P'CMAX_L = PCMAX_L,c,V2X (q)
P'CMAX_H = MAX {PCMAX_H (p,q) , PCMAX_H (p+1,q)}
For the reference subframe q duration when V2X carrier leads:
P'CMAX_L   = PCMAX_L,cE-UTRA (p)
P'CMAX_H  = MAX {PCMAX_H   (p-1,q) , PCMAX_H  (p,q)}
where PCMAX_L,,cE-UTRA (p) and PCMAX_H are the applicable limits for each overlapping subframe pairs above 4case with
(p,q), (p, q-1) or (p,q), (p, q+1) or (p,q), (p+1,q) or (p,q), (p-1, q). The measured total configured maximum output
power PUMAX shall be within the following bounds:
P’CMAX_L ? TLOW (P’CMAX_L) ≤ PUMAX ≤ P’CMAX_H + THIGH (P’CMAX_H)
with the tolerances TLOW(PCMAX) and THIGH(PCMAX) for applicable values of PCMAX specified in Table 6.2.5G.2.3-1.

1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.2EA.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuous uplink power control "down" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at its minimum output power.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the associated measurement bandwidth specified in Table 6.3.2EA.5-1 for
the specific channel bandwidth under test. The period of measurement shall be the continuous duration of one
sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are not under test. For HD-FDD slots with transient
periods and Half-duplex guard subframe are not under test.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.3.3.
Transmit OFF power is defined as the mean power when the transmitter is OFF. The transmitter is considered to be
OFF when the UE is not allowed to transmit or during periods when the UE is not transmitting a sub-frame. During
DTX and measurements gaps, the UE is not considered to be OFF.
An excess transmit OFF power potentially increases the Rise over Thermal (RoT) and therefore reduces the cell
coverage area for other UEs.
6.3.3EA.4	Test description
This test is covered by clause 6.3.4EA.1 General ON/OFF time mask and 6.3.4EA.2 PRACH and SRS time mask.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands and intra-band contiguous and non-
contiguous carrier aggregation, the general output power ON/OFF time mask specified in subclause 6.3.4.1.3 is
applicable for each component carrier during the ON power period and the transient periods. The OFF period as
specified in subclause 6.3.4.1.3 shall only be applicable for each component carrier when all the component carriers are
OFF.
The normative references for this requirement are TS 36.101 [2] clauses 6.3.4A and 6.3.4.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.3.4A.1.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.3.4A.1.1.4.3.
6.3.4A.1.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.3.4A.1.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.3.4A.1.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data
to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. The each UL assignment is such that the UE
transmits on UL sub-frame 2 of every radio frame.
5.	For FDD: Measure the UE transmission OFF power for each component carrier during the sub-frame prior to the
PUSCH subframe. For TDD: Measure the UE transmission OFF power during the 10 SCFDMA symbols prior to
the PUSCH subframe.
6.	Measure the output power of the UE PUSCH transmission for each component carrier during one sub-frame,
excluding a transient period of 20 ?s at the beginning of the subframe.
7.	Measure the UE transmission OFF power for each component carrier during one sub-frame following the
PUSCH subframe, excluding a transient period of 20 ?s at the beginning of the subframe.

6.3.4EA.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	The SS sends uplink scheduling information via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A with TPC command 0dB for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.4EA.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. For FDD and TDD: The UL
assignment is such that the UE transmits on UL sub-frame 2 of every radio frame. For HD-FDD: The UL
assignment is such that the UE transmits on UL sub-frame 5 of every radio frame.
2.	For FDD and HD-FDD: Measure the UE transmission OFF power during the sub-frame prior to the PUSCH
subframe. For TDD: Measure the UE transmission OFF power during the 10 SCFDMA symbols prior to the
PUSCH subframe.
3.	Measure the output power of the UE PUSCH transmission during one sub-frame, excluding a transient period of
20 ?s at the beginning of the subframe.
4.	Measure the UE transmission OFF power during one sub-frame following the PUSCH subframe, excluding a

6.3.5	Power Control
Power control is used to limit the interference level and compensate the channel fading. The UE power is defined as the
mean power in a subframe or ON power duration, whichever is available.
The UE transmission can be in two contiguity modes, i.e. contiguous transmission and non-contiguous transmission.
The former has a transmission gap of 0 and the later has a transmission gap larger than 0. The transmission gap is the
time interval between the end of the last UE transmission subframe and the beginning of the next UE transmission
subframe or the UpPTS (for TDD).
6.3.5.1	Power Control Absolute power tolerance
6.3.5.1.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of the UE transmitter to set its initial output power to a specific value at the start of a contiguous
transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a long transmission gap, i.e. transmission gap is larger than 20 ms.
6.3.5.1.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward.
6.3.5.1.3	Minimum conformance requirement
Absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its initial output power to a specific value for the first
sub-frame at the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a transmission gap larger than
20ms.
The minimum requirement on absolute power tolerance is given in Table 6.3.5.1.3-1 over the power range bounded by
the Maximum output power as defined in sub-clause 6.2.2 and the Minimum output power as defined in sub clause
6.3.2.
For operating bands under Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1, the absolute power tolerance as specified in Table 6.3.5.1.3-1 is
relaxed by reducing the lower limit by 1.5 dB when the transmission bandwidth is confined within FUL_low and FUL_low +
4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high.

6.3.5.2	Power Control Relative power tolerance
6.3.5.2.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of the UE transmitter to set its output power relatively to the power in a target sub-frame relatively
to the power of the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame if the transmission gap between these sub-frames is ≤
20 ms.
6.3.5.2.2	Test applicability
This test applies to all types of E-UTRA Power Class 3 UE release 8 and forward.
6.3.5.2.3	Minimum conformance requirement
The UE shall meet the requirements specified in Table 6.3.5.2.3-1.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of two test patterns. The test
patterns are a monotonically increasing power sweep and a monotonically decreasing power sweep over a range
bounded by the requirements of minimum power and maximum power specified in clauses 6.3.2.3 and 6.2.2.3. For
these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.0 dB in Table 6.3.5.2.3-1.

Note 1:	For extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation is allowed
Note 2:	For operating bands under Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1, the relative power
tolerance is relaxed by increasing the upper limit by 1.5 dB if the
transmission bandwidth of the reference sub-frames is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high and the target
sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency ranges; if
the transmission bandwidth of the target sub-frame is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high and the
reference sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency
ranges, then the tolerance is relaxed by reducing the lower limit by 1.5
dB.
Note 3:	For PUSCH to PUSCH transitions with the allocated resource blocks
fixed in frequency and no transmission gaps other than those generated
by downlink subframes, DwPTS fields or Guard Periods for TDD: for a
power step ΔP ≤ 1 dB, the relative power tolerance for transmission is
±1.0 dB.

The power step (ΔP) is defined as the difference in the calculated setting of the UE Transmit power between the target
and reference sub-frames with the power setting according to Clause 5.1 of TS 36.213. The error is the difference
between ΔP and the power change measured at the UE antenna port with the power of the cell-specific reference signals
kept constant. The error shall be less than the relative power tolerance specified in Table 6.3.5.2.3-1.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.3.5.2.
6.3.5.2.4	Test description

6.3.5.2.4.2	Test procedure
The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control. The power patterns
of the subtests are described in figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-4: TDD ramping down test power patterns


Figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-5: Alternating Test Power patterns

1.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
1.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -
36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5.2.5-12 depending on
channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit a +1dB
TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that interruptions are
whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
1.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between subframes
are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the subframe
are excluded.
1.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
2.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
2.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at +18.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at
+17.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5.2.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5.2.5-12 depending on
channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit a -1dB
TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that interruptions are
whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
2.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between subframes
are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the subframe
are excluded.
2.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
3.	Sub test: alternating pattern
3.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink
MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure
that the UE transmits PUSCH at -10dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -10dBm +/- 3.5
dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz. The initial uplink RB allocation is defined as the smaller
uplink RB allocation value specified in tables 6.3.5.2.5-13. The power level and RB allocation are reset for
each sub-test.
3.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5.2.4.2-5for 10 sub-frames with
an uplink RB allocation alternating pattern as defined in table 6.3.5.2.5-13 while transmitting 0dB TPC
command for PUSCH via the PDCCH.
3.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements specified in clause 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us
between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the
beginning of the subframe are excluded.
6.3.5.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.3.5.2.5	Test requirement
Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5.2.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in Table
6.3.5.2.5-1, thru 6.3.5.2.5-13 for normal conditions; for extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation is allowed.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB. If there is an exception in the
power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

1. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.3.5.3.4.1-1 (PUCCH sub-test)
and Table 6.3.5.3.4.1-2 (PUSCH sub-test).
5. Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in clause
6.3.5.3.4.3.
6.3.5.3.4.2	Test procedure
The procedure is separated in two subtests to verify PUCCH and PUSCH aggregate power control tolerance
respectively. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure 6.3.5.3.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5.3.4.2-1 Test uplink transmission

1. PUCCH sub test:
1.1 The SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
6.3.5.3.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The transmission of PDSCH will
make the UE send uplink ACK/NACK using PUCCH. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH to the
UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUCCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/-
3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2. Every 5 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0 dB TPC command for
PUCCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with transmission gap of 4
subframes. The downlink transmission is scheduled in the appropriate sub-frames to make the UE transmit
PUCCH as described in figure 6.3.5.3.4.2-1.
1.3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUCCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUCCH power is
maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
2. PUSCH sub test:
2.1. The SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH.
Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL
RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at
0dBm +/- 3.2.dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.
2.2. Every 5 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for PUSCH
via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH with 4 subframes gap. The uplink transmission patterns are
described in figure 6.3.5.3.4.2-1.
2.3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUSCH power is
maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
6.3.5.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.3.5.3.5	Test requirement
The requirement for the power measurements made in step (1.3) and (2.3) of the test procedure shall not exceed the

6.3.5A.2	Power Control Relative power tolerance for CA
6.3.5A.2.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the relative power tolerance is specified
when the power of the target and reference sub-frames on each component carrier exceed the minimum output power as
defined in TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.3.2A and the total power is limited by PUMAX as defined in TS 36.101 [2]
subclause 6.2.5A. The requirements shall apply on each component carrier with all component carriers active. The UE
transmitter shall have the capability of changing the output power independently on all component carriers in the uplink
and:
a)	the requirements for all combinations of PUSCH and PUCCH transitions per component carrier is given in Table
6.3.5A.2.0-1.
b)	for SRS the requirements for combinations of PUSCH/PUCCH and SRS transitions between subframes given in
Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1 apply per component carrier when the target and reference subframes are configured for
either simultaneous SRS or simultaneous PUSCH.
c)	for RACH the requirements apply for the primary cell and are given in Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation bandwidth class B and C and intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation, the requirements apply when the power of the target and reference sub-frames on each component carrier
exceed -20 dBm and the total power is limited by PUMAX as defined in TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.2.5A. For the purpose
of these requirements, the power in each component carrier is specified over only the transmitted resource blocks.
The UE shall meet the following requirements for transmission on both assigned component carriers when the average
transmit power per PRB is aligned across both assigned carriers in the reference sub-frame:
a)	for all possible combinations of PUSCH and PUCCH transitions per component carrier, the corresponding
requirements given in Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1;
b)	for SRS transitions on each component carrier, the requirements for combinations of PUSCH/PUCCH and SRS
transitions given in Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1 with simultaneous SRS of constant SRS bandwidth allocated in the target
and reference subframes;
c)	for RACH on the primary component carrier, the requirements given in Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1 for PRACH.
For a) and b) above, the power step ?P between the reference and target subframes shall be set by a TPC command
and/or an uplink scheduling grant transmitted by means of an appropriate DCI Format.
For a), b) and c) above, two exceptions are allowed for each component carrier for a power per carrier ranging from -20
dBm to PUMAX,c as defined in TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.2.5. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is ±6.0 dB in

Note 1:	For extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation is allowed
Note 2:	For operating bands under Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.3-1, the relative power
tolerance is relaxed by increasing the upper limit by 1.5 dB if the
transmission bandwidth of the reference sub-frames is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high - 4 MHz and FUL_high and the target
sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency ranges; if
the transmission bandwidth of the target sub-frame is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high - 4 MHz and FUL_high and the
reference sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency
ranges, then the tolerance is relaxed by reducing the lower limit by 1.5
dB.
Note 3:	For PUSCH to PUSCH transitions with the allocated resource blocks
fixed in frequency and no transmission gaps other than those generated
by downlink subframes, DwPTS fields or Guard Periods for TDD: for a
power step ΔP ≤ 1 dB, the relative power tolerance for transmission is
±1.0 dB.

The power step (ΔP) is defined as the difference in the calculated setting of the UE Transmit power between the target
and reference sub-frames with the power setting according to Clause 5.1 of TS 36.213 [10]. The error is the difference
between ΔP and the power change measured at the UE antenna port with the power of the cell-specific reference signals
kept constant. The error shall be less than the relative power tolerance specified in Table 6.3.5A.2.0-1.
For sub-frames not containing an SRS symbol, the power change is defined as the relative power difference between the
mean power of the original reference sub-frame and the mean power of the target subframe not including transient
durations. The mean power of successive sub-frames shall be calculated according to TS 36.101 [2] Figure 6.3.4.3-1
and TS 36.101 [2] Figure 6.3.4.1-1 if there is a transmission gap between the reference and target sub-frames.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clauses 6.3.5A.2 and 6.3.5.2.
6.3.5A.2.1	Power Control Relative power tolerance for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA

least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clause 8.3.3.2).
4.	The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control. The power
changes of the subtests are shown by diagrams in the Test Procedure. In this test case, the term PCMAX_L  ?
MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) } defined in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.5A is used, to ensure the UE is not tested outside
its power capability.
5.	Sub test: SCC power increase
5.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both PCC and SCC.
Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL
RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that the
UE transmits PUSCH on the PCC and on the SCC with powers nearest to PCCRefSet, 0 and SCCRefSet, 0
respectively, as defined in Table 6.3.5A.2.1.4.2-1. The powers and allocations are chosen so the average transmit
power per PRB is aligned across both assigned carriers in the reference sub-frame. Measure PCCRefMeas, 0 and
SCCRefMeas, 0 in the Reference subframe, and after the SCC allocation is increased, measure PCCTargetMeas, 0 and
SCCTargetMeas, 0 in the Target subframe.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, only the first of those
is tested, according to the order in the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	The UL allocation is changed as part of the test procedure. The Test Configuration Table entries list the
combinations used, with the sequence of usage as determined by the test procedure for each sub-test.
Note 4:	The starting resource block shall be RB# 0.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.3.5A.1.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.3.5A.2.2.4.3.
6.3.5A.2.2.4.2	Test procedure

1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clause 8.3.3.2).
4.	The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control on both PCC
and SCC individually. The power patterns of the subtests are shown in figure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-1 to 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-
4. In this test case, the term PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) } defined in TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.2.5A is
used, to ensure the UE is not tested outside its power capability.

Figure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-3: TDD ramping up test power patterns


Figure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-4: TDD ramping down test power patterns

5.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
5.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both PCC and
SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that
the UE transmits PUSCH on the PCC and on the SCC at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at -36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
5.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission on each component carrier as described in Figure
6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) and Figure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames
with 4 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5A.2.2.5-1
thru 6.3.5A.2.2.5-12 depending on CC combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH
the SS will transmit a +1dB TPC command on both PCC and SCC separately. Note that the measurement need
not be done continuously, provided that interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB
are sent during the interruption.
5.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both PCC and SCC separately to verify the UE relative
power control meet test requirements 6.3.5A.2.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of
40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the
beginning of the subframe are excluded. Calculate the Total uplink power across both CCs. If (PCMAX_L  ?
MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) } - Total uplink power) < 0.7dB, stop ramping, exclude the last measurement and go
to step 5.4.5.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points
in the pattern as described in Table 6.3.5A.2.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5A.2.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at
various points in the power range.
6.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
6.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both PCC and
SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that
the UE transmits PUSCH on the PCC and on the SCC at +15.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at +14.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
6.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5A.2.2.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5A.2.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5A.2.2.5-12 depending
on CC combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit a -1dB TPC
command on both PCC and SCC separately. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided
that interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
6.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both PCC and SCC separately to verify the UE relative
power control meet test requirements 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of
40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the
beginning of the subframe are excluded.
6.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the pattern as
described in Table 6.3.5A.2.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5A.2.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various points in
the power range.
6.3.5A.2.2.4.3	Message contents

Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.3.5A.2.2.5	Test requirement

Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5A.2.2.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in
Table 6.3.5A.2.2.5-1, thru 6.3.5A.2.2.5-12 for normal conditions; for extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB
relaxation is allowed.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns on both PCC and SCC separately. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB.
If there is an exception in the power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

6.3.5A.3.1.4.2	Test procedure

Figure 6.3.5A.3.1.4.2-1: Test uplink transmission

1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	The procedure is separated in two subtests to verify PUCCH and PUSCH aggregate power control tolerance
respectively. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure 6.3.5A.3.1.4.2-1.
5.	PUCCH sub test:
5.1	The SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to
Table 6.3.5A.3.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
The transmission of PDSCH will make the UE send uplink ACK/NACK using PUCCH on PCC. Send the
appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUCCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2
dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
5.2	Every 5 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0 dB TPC command
for PUCCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with transmission gap of 4
subframes. The downlink transmission is scheduled in the appropriate sub-frames to make the UE transmit
PUCCH as described in figure 6.3.5A.3.1.4.2-1.
5.3	Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUCCH transmissions on PCC to verify the UE transmitted PUCCH
power is maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
6.	PUSCH sub test:
6.1	The SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5A.3.1.4.1-2 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE
has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send
the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at 0dBm +/-
3.2.dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
6.2	Every 5 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for
PUSCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH with 4 subframes gap. The uplink transmission
patterns are described in figure 6.3.5A.3.1.4.2-1.
6.3	Measure the power on both PCC and SCC of 5 consecutive PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE
transmitted PUSCH power is maintained within 21 ms on each component carrier. The transient periods of
20us are excluded from the power measurement.
6.3.5A.3.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.3.5A.3.1.5	Test requirement

The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control. The power patterns
of the subtests are described in figure 6.3.5B.2.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5B.2.4.2-5: Alternating Test Power patterns

1.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
1.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5B.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC
commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5B.2.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5B.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5B.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5B.2.5-12
depending on channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 4 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will
transmit a +1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
1.3.	Measure the mean sum power at each antenna connector for PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE
relative power control meet test requirements 6.3.5B.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient
periods of 40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20
us at the beginning of the subframe are excluded.
1.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5B.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5B.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
2.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
2.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5B.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC
commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at +18.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at +17.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5B.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5B.2.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5B.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5B.2.5-12
depending on channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 4 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will
transmit a -1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
2.3.	Measure the mean sum power at each antenna connector for PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE
relative power control meet test requirements 6.3.5B.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient
periods of 40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20
us at the beginning of the subframe are excluded.
2.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5B.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5B.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
3.	Sub test: alternating pattern
3.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5B.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC
commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -10dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -10dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz. The initial uplink
RB allocation is defined as the smaller uplink RB allocation value specified in tables 6.3.5B.2.5-13. The
power level and RB allocation are reset for each sub-test.
3.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5B.2.4.2-5for 10 sub-frames with
an uplink RB allocation alternating pattern as defined in table 6.3.5B.2.5-13 while transmitting 0dB TPC
command for PUSCH via the PDCCH.
3.3.	Measure the mean sum power of each antenna connector for PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE
relative power control meet test requirements specified in clause 6.3.5B.2.5. For power transients between
subframes, transient periods of 40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients,
transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the subframe are excluded.
6.3.5B.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6.
6.3.5B.2.5	Test requirement
Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5B.2.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in Table
6.3.5B.2.5-1, thru 6.3.5B.2.5-13 for normal conditions; for extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation is
allowed.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB. If there is an exception in the
power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

6.3.5B.3.4.2	Test procedure
The procedure is separated in two subtests to verify PUCCH and PUSCH aggregate power control tolerance
respectively. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure 6.3.5B.3.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5B.3.4.2-1 Test uplink transmission

1.	PUCCH sub test:
1.1	The SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to
Table 6.3.5B.3.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The transmission of
PDSCH will make the UE send uplink ACK/NACK using PUCCH. Send the appropriate TPC commands for
PUCCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUCCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤
3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2.	Every 5 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0 dB TPC
command for PUCCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with
transmission gap of 4 subframes. The downlink transmission is scheduled in the appropriate sub-frames to
make the UE transmit PUCCH as described in figure 6.3.5B.3.4.2-1.
1.3.	Measure the mean sum power at each antenna connector for UE of 5 consecutive PUCCH transmissions
to verify the UE transmitted PUCCH power is maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are
excluded from the power measurement.
2.	PUSCH sub test:
2.1.	The SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 4 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL
RMC according to Table 6.3.5B.3.4.1-2. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE
sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE
to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2.dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/-
3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.2.	Every 5 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for
PUSCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH with 4 subframes gap. The uplink transmission
patterns are described in figure 6.3.5B.3.4.2-1.
2.3.	Measure the mean sum power at each antenna connector for UE of 5 consecutive PUSCH transmissions
to verify the UE transmitted PUSCH power is maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are
excluded from the power measurement.

Note 1:	DC Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each DC Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	If in the DC Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, only the first of those
is tested, according to the order in the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	The UL allocation is changed as part of the test procedure. The Test Configuration Table entries list the
combinations used, with the sequence of usage as determined by the test procedure for each sub-test.
Note 4:	The starting resource block shall be RB# 0.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for MCG CC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.3.5A.1.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-DC1 according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2A. Message contents are defined
in clause 6.3.5C.2.2.4.3.
6.3.5C.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCG CC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels with a time
offset of +33 us compared to PCC.
3.	SS activates SCG CC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for
at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clause 8.3.3.2).
4.	The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control on both MCG
CC and SCG CC individually. The power patterns of the subtests are shown in figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-1 to
6.3.5C.2.4.2-4. In this test case, the term PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) } defined in TS 36.101 [2] clause
6.2.5A is used, to ensure the UE is not tested outside its power capability.

Figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-4: TDD ramping down test power patterns

5.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
5.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both CC. Since
the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that the UE
transmits PUSCH on the MCG CC and on the SCG CC at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at -36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
5.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission on each component carrier as described in Figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-1
(FDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame)
and Figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink
sub-frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5C.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5C.2.5-12
depending on CC combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit
a +1dB TPC command on both CCs separately. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously,
provided that interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the
interruption.
5.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both CCs separately to verify the UE relative power control
meet test requirements 6.3.5C.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the
subframe are excluded. Calculate the Total uplink power across both CCs. If (PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL,
TLOW(PCMAX_L) } - Total uplink power) < 0.7dB, stop ramping, exclude the last measurement and go to step
5.4.5.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5C.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5C.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
6.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
6.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both CCs. Since
the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that the UE
transmits PUSCH on the MCG CC and on the SCG CC at +15.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at +14.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
6.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-test
is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure 6.3.5C.2.4.2-
4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-frames per radio
frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5C.2.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5C.2.5-12 depending on CC
combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit a -1dB TPC
command on both CCs separately. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
6.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both CCs separately to verify the UE relative power control
meet test requirements 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the
subframe are excluded.
6.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the pattern as
described in Table 6.3.5C.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5C.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various points in the

6.3.5C.2.5	Test requirement
Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5C.2.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in Table
6.3.5C.2.5-1, thru 6.3.5C.2.5-12 for normal conditions.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns on both PCC and SCC separately. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB.
If there is an exception in the power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.3.5A.2.0.
6.3.5C.2_1.4	Test description
6.3.5C.2_1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on E-
UTRA DC configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-2. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each DC Configuration, and are shown in table 6.3.5C.2_1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference
measurement channel (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	DC Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each DC Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	If in the DC Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg, only the first of those
is tested, according to the order in the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	The UL allocation is changed as part of the test procedure. The Test Configuration Table entries list the
combinations used, with the sequence of usage as determined by the test procedure for each sub-test.
Note 4:	The starting resource block shall be RB# 0.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for MCG CC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.3.5C.2_1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-DC1 according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2A. Message contents are defined
in clause 6.3.5C.2_1.4.3.
6.3.5C.2_1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCG CC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels with a time
offset of +500 us compared to PCC.
3.	SS activates SCG CC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for
at least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clause 8.3.3.2).
4.	The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control on both MCG
CC and SCG CC individually. The power patterns of the subtests are shown in figure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-1 to
6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-4. In this test case, the term PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL, TLOW(PCMAX_L) } defined in TS 36.101 [2]
clause 6.2.5A is used, to ensure the UE is not tested outside its power capability.

Figure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-3: TDD ramping up test power patterns


Figure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-4: TDD ramping down test power patterns

5.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
5.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both CC. Since
the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that the UE
transmits PUSCH on the MCG CC and on the SCG CC at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at -36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
5.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission on each component carrier as described in Figure
6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) and Figure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames
with 4 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5C.2_1.5-
1 thru 6.3.5C.2_1.5-12 depending on CC combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the
PUSCH the SS will transmit a +1dB TPC command on both CCs separately. Note that the measurement need not
be done continuously, provided that interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are
sent during the interruption.
5.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both CCs separately to verify the UE relative power control
meet test requirements 6.3.5C.2_1.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the
subframe are excluded. Calculate the Total uplink power across both CCs. If (PCMAX_L  ? MAX{TL,
TLOW(PCMAX_L) } - Total uplink power) < 0.7dB, stop ramping, exclude the last measurement and go to step
5.4.5.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5C.2_1.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5C.2_1.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at
various points in the power range.
6.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
6.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table A.2.2.2.1-1 (FDD) or Table A.2.3.2.1-1 (TDD) on both CCs. Since
the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH on each component carrier to the UE to ensure that the UE
transmits PUSCH on the MCG CC and on the SCG CC at +15.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz
or at +14.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
6.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5C.2_1.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-frames
per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5C.2_1.5-1 thru 6.3.5C.2_1.5-12
depending on CC combinations. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit
a -1dB TPC command on both CCs separately. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously,
provided that interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the
interruption.
6.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions on both CCs separately to verify the UE relative power control
meet test requirements 6.3.5.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the
subframe are excluded.
6.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the pattern as
described in Table 6.3.5C.2_1.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5C.2_1.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various points
in the power range.

6.3.5C.2_1.5	Test requirement
Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5C.2_1.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in
Table 6.3.5C.2_1.5-1, thru 6.3.5C.2_1.5-12 for normal conditions.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns on both PCC and SCC separately. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB.
If there is an exception in the power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

6.3.5E.2.4.2	Test procedure
The procedure is separated in various subtests to verify different aspects of relative power control. The power patterns
of the subtests are described in figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-6: HD-FDD ramping down test power patterns


Figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-7: Alternating Test Power patterns

1.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
1.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -
36.5dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5E.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5E.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5E.2.5-12
depending on channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will
transmit a +1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
1.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements 6.3.5E.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of
the subframe are excluded.
1.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5E.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5E.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
2.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
2.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at +18.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at
+17.7dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-
test is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) and Figure
6.3.5E.2.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in tables 6.3.5E.2.5-1 thru 6.3.5E.2.5-12
depending on channel bandwidth. On the PDCCH format 0 for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will
transmit a -1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
2.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements 6.3.5E.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between
subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of
the subframe are excluded.
2.4.	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the
pattern as described in Table 6.3.5E.2.5-1 thru Table 6.3.5E.2.5-12 to force bigger UE power steps at various
points in the power range.
3.	Sub test: alternating pattern
3.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink
MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure
that the UE transmits PUSCH at -10dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -10dBm +/- 3.5
dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz. The initial uplink RB allocation is defined as the smaller
uplink RB allocation value specified in tables 6.3.5E.2.5-13. The power level and RB allocation are reset for
each sub-test.
3.2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5E.2.4.2-5for 10 sub-frames with
an uplink RB allocation alternating pattern as defined in table 6.3.5E.2.5-13 while transmitting 0dB TPC
command for PUSCH via the PDCCH.
3.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements specified in clause 6.3.5E.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of
40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the
beginning of the subframe are excluded.

allowed.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB. If there is an exception in the
power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

The procedure is separated in two subtests to verify PUCCH and PUSCH aggregate power control tolerance
respectively. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure 6.3.5E.3.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5: E.3.4.2-1 Test uplink transmission

1. PUCCH sub test:
1.1 The SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table
6.3.5E.3.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The transmission of PDSCH will
make the UE send uplink ACK/NACK using PUCCH. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH to the
UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUCCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/-
3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2. Every 5 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0 dB TPC command for
PUCCH via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with transmission gap of 4
subframes. The downlink transmission is scheduled in the appropriate sub-frames to make the UE transmit
PUCCH as described in figure 6.3.5E.3.4.2-1.
1.3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUCCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUCCH power is
maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
2. PUSCH sub test:
2.1. The SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH.
Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL
RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at
0dBm +/- 3.2.dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.
2.2. Every 5 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for PUSCH
via the PDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH with 4 subframes gap. The uplink transmission patterns are
described in figure 6.3.5E.3.4.2-1.
2.3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUSCH power is
maintained within 21 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.

6.3.5EA.1.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of the UE transmitter to set its initial output power to a specific value at the start of a contiguous
transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a long transmission gap, i.e. transmission gap is larger than 20 ms.
6.3.5EA.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
6.3.5EA.1.3	Minimum conformance requirement
Absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its initial output power to a specific value for the first
sub-frame at the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a transmission gap larger than
20ms.
The minimum requirement on absolute power tolerance is given in Table 6.3.5EA.1.3-1 over the power range bounded
by the Maximum output power as defined in sub-clause 6.2.2EA and the Minimum output power as defined in sub
clause 6.3.2.
For operating bands under Note 2 in Table 6.2.2EA-1, the absolute power tolerance as specified in Table 6.5EA.1.3-1 is
relaxed by reducing the lower limit by 1.5 dB when the transmission bandwidth is confined within FUL_low and FUL_low +
4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high.

6.3.5EA.2.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of the UE transmitter to set its output power relatively to the power in a target sub-frame relatively
to the power of the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame if the transmission gap between these sub-frames is ≤
20 ms.
6.3.5EA.2.2	Test applicability

6.3.5EA.2.3	Minimum conformance requirement
The UE shall meet the requirements specified in Table 6.3.5EA.2.3-1.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of two test patterns. The test
patterns are a monotonically increasing power sweep and a monotonically decreasing power sweep over a range
bounded by the requirements of minimum power and maximum power specified in clauses 6.3.2.3 and 6.2.2EA.3. For

Note 1:	For extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation is allowed
Note 2:	For operating bands under Note 2 in Table 6.2.2.EA-1, the relative
power tolerance is relaxed by increasing the upper limit by 1.5 dB if the
transmission bandwidth of the reference sub-frames is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high and the target
sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency ranges; if
the transmission bandwidth of the target sub-frame is confined within
FUL_low and FUL_low + 4 MHz or FUL_high ? 4 MHz and FUL_high and the
reference sub-frame is not confined within any one of these frequency
ranges, then the tolerance is relaxed by reducing the lower limit by 1.5
dB.
Note 3:	For PUSCH to PUSCH transitions with the allocated resource blocks
fixed in frequency and no transmission gaps other than those generated
by downlink subframes, DwPTS fields or Guard Periods for TDD: for a
power step ΔP ≤ 1 dB, the relative power tolerance for transmission is
±1.0 dB.

The power step (ΔP) is defined as the difference in the calculated setting of the UE Transmit power between the target
and reference sub-frames with the power setting according to Clause 5.1 of TS 36.213. The error is the difference
between ΔP and the power change measured at the UE antenna port with the power of the cell-specific reference signals
kept constant. The error shall be less than the relative power tolerance specified in Table 6.5EA.2.3-1.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.3.5.2 and 6.3.5E.

6.3.5EA.2.4.2	Test procedure

Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-7: Alternating Test Power patterns

1.	Sub test: ramping up pattern
1.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -36.8dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz.
1.2	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-1 (FDD pattern A: sub-test
is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame)  Figure
6.3.5EA.2.4.2-3 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) and Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-5 (HD-FDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 14 arbitrary
radio frames with 3 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame) with an uplink RB allocation as defined in
tables 6.3.5EA.2.5-1. On the MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will
transmit a +1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that
interruptions are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
1.3	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test requirements
6.3.5EA.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between subframes are
excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the subframe are
excluded.
1.4	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the pattern as
described in Table 6.3.5EA.2.5-1 to force bigger UE power steps at various points in the power range.
2.	Sub test: ramping down pattern
2.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at +18.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz with UE
power class 3 or +15.0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz with UE power class 5.
2.2	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-2 (FDD pattern A: sub-test
is divided in 4 arbitrary radio frames with 10 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame), Figure
6.3.5EA.2.4.2-4 (TDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 10 arbitrary radio frames with 4 active uplink sub-
frames per radio frame) and Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-6 (HD-FDD pattern A: sub-test is divided in 14 arbitrary
radio frames with 3 active uplink sub-frames per radio frame)with an uplink RB allocation as defined in table
6.3.5EA.2.5-2. On the MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for the scheduling of the PUSCH the SS will transmit a -
1dB TPC command. Note that the measurement need not be done continuously, provided that interruptions
are whole numbers of frames, and TPC commands of 0dB are sent during the interruption.
2.3	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test requirements
6.3.5EA.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of 40us between subframes are
excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the beginning of the subframe are
excluded.
2.4	Repeat the subtest different pattern B, C to move the RB allocation change at different points in the pattern as
described in Table 6.3.5EA.2.5-2 to force bigger UE power steps at various points in the power range.
3.	Sub test: alternating pattern
3.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via P MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits PUSCH at -10dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at -10dBm +/-
3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz. The initial uplink RB allocation is defined as the smaller
uplink RB allocation value specified in table 6.3.5EA.2.5-3. The power level and RB allocation are reset for
each sub-test.
3.2	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2-7 for 10 sub-frames (FDD
and TDD) and 20 sub-frames (HD-FDD) with an uplink RB allocation alternating pattern as defined in table
6.3.5EA.2.5-3 while transmitting 0dB TPC command for PUSCH via the MPDCCH.
3.3.	Measure the power of PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE relative power control meet test
requirements specified in clause 6.3.5EA.2.5. For power transients between subframes, transient periods of
40us between subframes are excluded. For ON/OFF or OFF/ON transients, transient periods of 20 us at the
beginning of the subframe are excluded.
6.3.5EA.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.3.5EA.2.5	Test requirement
Each UE power step measured in the test procedure 6.3.5EA.2.4.2 should satisfy the test requirements specified in
Table 6.3.5EA.2.5-1, thru 6.3.5EA.2.5-3 for normal conditions; for extreme conditions an additional ± 2.0 dB relaxation
is allowed.
To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes 2 exceptions are allowed for each of ramping up and ramping down
test patterns. For these exceptions the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ±6.7 dB. If there is an exception in the
power step caused by the RB change for all test patterns (A, B, C) then fail the UE.

1.1	The SS transmits PDSCH via M-PDCCH DCI format 6-1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to
Table 6.3.5EA.3.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC. The transmission of PDSCH
will make the UE send uplink ACK/NACK using PUCCH. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH to
the UE to ensure that the UE transmits PUCCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2 dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm
+/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
1.2.	For FDD and TDD: Every 5 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0
dB TPC command for PUCCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with
transmission gap of 4 subframes. For HD-FDD with the channel bandwidth 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz: Subframes #0
and #2 every 10 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding bits as well as 0 dB TPC
command for PUCCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the PUCCH with
transmission gap of 1 ms after subframe #4 and 7 ms after subframe #6. For HD-FDD with the channel
bandwidth 1.4 and 3 MHz: Subframe #3 every 10 subframes transmit to the UE downlink PDSCH MAC padding
bits as well as 0 dB TPC command for PUCCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE transmit ACK/NACK on the
PUCCH with transmission gap of 9 ms after subframe #7. The downlink transmission is scheduled in the
appropriate sub-frames to make the UE transmit PUCCH as described in figure 6.3.5EA.3.4.2-1.
1.3.	Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUCCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUCCH power is
maintained within 21 ms for FDD and TDD with any channel bandwidth and HD-FDD with the channel
bandwidth 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz, within 41 ms for HD-FDD with the channel bandwidth 1.4 and 3 MHz. The
transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
2.	PUSCH sub test:
2.1.	The SS sends uplink scheduling information via M-PDCCH DCI format 6-0A for C_RNTI to schedule the
PUSCH. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC. Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the UE to ensure that the UE transmits
PUSCH at 0dBm +/- 3.2.dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or at 0dBm +/- 3.5 dB for carrier frequency
3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.2.	For FDD and TDD: Every 5 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC
command for PUSCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH with 4 subframes gap. For HD-FDD
with the channel bandwidth 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz: Subframes #4 and #6 every 10 subframes schedule the UE's
PUSCH data transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for PUSCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE
transmit PUSCH with transmission gap of 1 ms after subframe #4 and 7 ms after subframe #6. For HD-FDD
with the channel bandwidth 1.4 and 3 MHz: Subframe #6 every 10 subframes schedule the UE's PUSCH data
transmission and transmit 0 dB TPC command for PUSCH via the MPDCCH to make the UE transmit PUSCH
with transmission gap of 9 ms after subframe #6. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure
6.3.5EA.3.4.2-1.
2.3.	Measure the power of 5 consecutive PUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted PUSCH power is
maintained within 21 ms for FDD and TDD with any channel bandwidth and HD-FDD with the channel
bandwidth 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz, within 41 ms for HD-FDD with the channel bandwidth 1.4 and 3 MHz. The

6.3.5F.2	Power Control Relative power tolerance for category NB1
6.3.5F.2.1	Test purpose
To verify the ability of the UE transmitter to set its output power relatively to the power in a target sub-frame relatively
to the power of the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame if the transmission gap between these sub-frames is ≤
20 ms.
6.3.5F.2.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of UE release 13 and forward of category NB1.
6.3.5F.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
Category NB1 UE relative power control requirement is defined for NPRACH power step values of 0, 2, 4 and 6 dB.
For NPRACH transmission, the relative tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its output power relatively to
the power of the most recently transmitted preamble. The measurement period for the NPRACH preamble is specified
in Table 6.3.4F.2.3-1.
The requirements specified in Table 6.3.5F.2.3-1 apply when the power of the target and reference sub-frames are
within the power range bounded by the Minimum output power as defined in subclause 6.3.2F and the maximum output
power as defined in subclause 6.2.2F.

The power step (ΔP) is defined as the difference in the calculated setting of the UE Transmit power between the target
and reference sub-frames. The error is the difference between ΔP and the power change measured at the UE antenna
port with the power of the cell-specific reference signals kept constant. The error shall be less than the relative power
tolerance specified in Table 6.3.5F.2.3-1.

6.3.5F.3.4.2	Test procedure
The procedure is separated in two subtests to verify single tone and multi tone NPUSCH aggregate power control
tolerance respectively. The uplink transmission patterns are described in figure 6.3.5F.3.4.2-1.

Figure 6.3.5F.3.4.2-1 Test uplink transmission

For single tone NPUSCH transmission scenario:
1. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via NPDCCH DCI format N0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5F.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2. Every 48 slots (24 ms) schedule the UE's NPUSCH data transmission and make the UE transmit NPUSCH with 32
slots (16 ms) gap. Uplink scheduling grant is transmitted via NPDCCH eight subframes before NPUSCH
transmission.
3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive NPUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted NPUSCH power is
maintained within 104 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for configuration ID 2 in Table 6.3.5F.3.4.1-1.
For 12 tones NPUSCH transmission scenario:
0. SS release the connection through State 3A-NB and finally ensure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT
Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 8.1.5 and configure the UE to the new UL power level with
messages in Table 6.3.5F.3.4.3-2.
1. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via NPDCCH DCI format N0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3.5F.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2. Every 26 slots (13 ms) schedule the UE's NPUSCH data transmission and make the UE transmit NPUSCH with 24
slots (12 ms) gap. Uplink scheduling grant is transmitted via NPDCCH eight subframes before NPUSCH
transmission.
3. Measure the power of 5 consecutive NPUSCH transmissions to verify the UE transmitted NPUSCH power is
maintained within 53 ms. The transient periods of 20us are excluded from the power measurement.
