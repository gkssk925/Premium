6.5	Transmit signal quality
Editor's note:	The test cases for transmit signal quality: frequency error, EVM, carrier leakage, IBE, EVM equalizer
spectrum flatness are complete, except the following aspect is not determined:
-	Reference signal EVM and PRACH EVM minimum requirements from the core specification are still in
brackets.
In this clause a multitude of results are derived, all using one common algorithm returning these results: Global In-
Channels TX-Test (Annex E). Each sub clause of this clause contains a procedure and test requirements described for a
specific measurement. If all relevant test parameters in different sub clauses are the same, then the results, returned by
the Global In-Channel TX-Test, may be used across the applicable sub clauses.
For UE category M1, carrier centre frequency can be either at the centre of channel bandwidth or the 6RB narrowband
assigned for transmission. TE shall measure frequency error, EVM, carrier leakage, In-band emissions and EVM
equalizer spectrum flatness using Global In-Channels TX-Test (Annex E) according to the UE’s declaration on the
position of carrier centre frequency.
6.5.1	Frequency Error
6.5.1.1	Test purpose
This test verifies the ability of both, the receiver and the transmitter, to process frequency correctly.
Receiver: to extract the correct frequency from the stimulus signal, offered by the System simulator, under ideal
propagation conditions and low level.
Transmitter: to derive the correct modulated carrier frequency from the results, gained by the receiver.
6.5.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
6.5.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM observed over a period of one time slot
(0.5ms) compared to the carrier frequency received from the E-UTRA Node B.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.5.1
6.5.1.4	Test description
6.5.1.4.1	Initial condition
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in table 6.5.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	Depending on CA configurations, only the appropriate Uplink RB allocation value according to table 7.3A.0-1
for UE supporting two uplink carriers is tested per Test CA configuration.
Note 3:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of those
is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 4:	For the DL signal one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD is used.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The ULReference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.5.1A.4.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.5.1A.4.1.4.3.
6.5.1A.4.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.5.1A.4.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.1A.4.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Set the Downlink signal level for PCC and SCC to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in 7.3A.2.5. Send
continuously uplink power control "up" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE to ensure
the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the test.
6.	Measure the Frequency Error on PCC and SCC using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E) respectively. For
TDD slots with transient periods are not under test.

6.5.1G.1.5	Test requirement
The 20 frequency error Δf results must fulfil the test requirement:
|Δf| ≤ (0.1 PPM + 15 Hz)
6.5.2	Transmit modulation
Transmit modulation defines the modulation quality for expected in-channel RF transmissions from the UE. This
transmit modulation limit is specified in terms of:
-	Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resources blocks (RB),
-	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients generated by the EVM measurement
process
-	Carrier leakage
In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB
6.5.2.1	Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
6.5.2.1.1	Test Purpose
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured
waveform. This difference is called the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected
by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured
waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain.
The EVM result is defined after the front-end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.
The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH and is one slot for
the PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to
multiplexing with SRS, the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol, accordingly. The PUSCH or PUCCH
EVM measurement interval is also reduced when the mean power, modulation or allocation between slots is expected to
change. In the case of PUSCH transmission, the measurement interval is reduced by a time interval equal to the sum of
5 μs and the applicable exclusion period defined in subclause 6.3.4, adjacent to the boundary where the power change is
expected to occur. The PUSCH exclusion period is applied to the signal obtained after the front-end IDFT. In the case
of PUCCH transmission, the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the slot
boundary.
6.5.2.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
6.5.2.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
EVM measurements are evaluated for 10 uplink sub-frames excluding any transient period for the average EVM case,
and 60 subframes excluding any transient period for the reference signal EVM case, the different modulations schemes
shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.5.2.1.3-1 for the parameters defined in Table 6.5.2.1.3-2. For EVM
evaluation purposes, [all PRACH preamble formats 0-4 and] all PUCCH formats 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 2a and 2b are considered
to have the same EVM requirement as QPSK modulated.

1.1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
1.2	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
1.3	Measure the EVM and   using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E).
1.4	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is ?
36.8dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or -36.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.

Figure 6.5.2.1E.2.4.2-1: Test pattern

NOTE 1:	In TDD the free subframes are special subframes or DL, in FDD the free subframes are OFF.
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the PUSCH... Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC. The initial uplink RB allocation is 12 or 5. Send appropriate TPC commands for PUSCH to the
UE to ensure the UE transmits PUSCH at 0dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or 0dBm ±3.5 dB for
carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.	Schedule the UE's PUSCH data transmission as described in Figure 6.5.2.1E.2.4.2-1 for 161) active time slots
with an uplink RB allocation alternating pattern as described in table 6.5.2.1E.2.4.1-1 while transmitting 0dB
TPC command for PUSCH via the PDCCH.
3.	Measure the EVM using Global In-Channel Tx-Test. The averaging across 161) timeslots is done across mixed
RB allocations, as illustrated in Figure 6.5.2.1E.2.4.2-1
NOTE 2:	Averaging across 16 timeslots is used to represent each type of transition equally in the average.
6.5.2.1E.2.5	Test requirement

6.5.2.1F.1	Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for category NB1
6.5.2.1F.1.1	Test Purpose
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured
waveform. This difference is called the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected
by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured
waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain.
The EVM result is defined after the front-end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.

2.1	The SS shall set RS EPRE according to Table 6.5.2.1F.1.4.1-2.
2.2	NPRACH is set according to Table 6.5.2.1F.1.4.1-2.
2.3	The UE shall send a preamble to the SS.
2.4	In response to the preamble, the SS shall transmit a random access response not corresponding to the transmitted
random access preamble, or send no response.
2.5	The UE shall consider the random access response reception not successful then re-transmit the preamble with
the calculated NPRACH transmission power.
2.6	Repeat step 4 and 5 until the SS collect enough NPRACH preambles (2 preambles for format 0 and format 1).
Measure the EVM in NPRACH channel using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E). The measurement period
of EVM for 240/Ntones slots should exclude any transient period for the average EVM case, where Ntones = {1, 3,
6, 12} is the number of subcarriers for the NB-IoT transmission.
NOTE 1:	For configuration IDs applicable to UE depending on UE capability in Test Configuration Table with
different UL sub-carrier spacing, the SS shall release the connection through State 3A-NB and finally
ensure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 8.1.5
using the appropriate UL subcarrier spacing in Random Access Response message.

schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.2.2F.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC
2.	Configure UE to transmit at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure carrier leakage using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E).
4. Release the connection through State 3A-NB.
5. Modify system information elements according to Table 6.5.2.1F.1.4.3-1 and Table 6.5.2.1F.1.4.3-2 and notify
the UE via paging message with SystemInformationModification included (test point 2).
6. Ensure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 8.1.5 using the
new UL power control setting.
7. SS sends uplink scheduling information for UL HARQ process via NPDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.2.2F.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
8.	Measure carrier leakage using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E).
NOTE 1:	For configuration IDs applicable to UE depending on UE capability in Test Configuration Table with
different UL sub-carrier spacing, the SS shall release the connection through State 3A-NB and finally
ensure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 8.1.5
using the appropriate UL subcarrier spacing in Random Access Response message.

6.5.2.3	In-band emissions for non allocated RB
6.5.2.3.1	Test Purpose
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-allocated resources blocks
The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of
the allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a
non?allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB. The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is
defined over one slot in the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to
multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced by one SC-FDMA symbol, accordingly.
6.5.2.3.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
6.5.2.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The relative in-band emission shall not exceed the values specified in Tables 6.5.2.3.3-1 or 6.5.2.3.3-2.

1.1	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.2.3.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC
1.2	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is
13.2 dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or 13.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.
1.3	Measure In-band emission using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E)
1.4	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is
3.2 dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or 3.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.
1.5	Measure In-band emission using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E)
1.6	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is -

4.2GHz.
1.7	Measure In-band emission using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E). For TDD slots with transient periods are
not under test
1.8	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is to

power is 3.2 dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or 3.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f
≤ 4.2GHz.
2.5	Measure In-band emission using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E)
2.6	Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output
power is -26.8 dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or -26.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz
< f ≤ 4.2GHz.
2.7	Measure In-band emission using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E)
2.8	Send the appropriate TPC commands for PUCCH in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output
power is to -36.8 dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or -36.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency

NOTE 1:	An in-band emissions combined limit is evaluated in each non-allocated RB. For each such RB, the
minimum requirement is calculated as the higher of PRB - 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values
(General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply. PRB is defined in NOTE 10.
NOTE 2:	The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in one non-
allocated RB to the measured average power per allocated RB, where the averaging is done across all
allocated RBs.
NOTE 3:	The applicable frequencies for this limit are those that are enclosed in the reflection of the allocated
bandwidth, based on symmetry with respect to the centre carrier frequency, but excluding any allocated
RBs. For UE of UL Category M1, applicable frequencies shall alternatively include those found by reflection
on the centre of the assigned 6 RB narrowband, but excluding any allocated RBs.
NOTE 4:	The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in one non-
allocated RB to the measured total power in all allocated RBs.
NOTE 5:	The applicable frequencies for this limit are those that are enclosed in the RBs containing the DC
frequency if   is odd, or in the two RBs immediately adjacent to the DC frequency if   is even, but
excluding any allocated RB. For UE of UL Category M1, the applicable frequencies shall alternatively be
the centre frequency of the supported 6RBs additionally.
NOTE 6:	  is the Transmission Bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1).

  or   for the first adjacent RB outside of the allocated bandwidth.
NOTE 10:	  is the transmitted power per 180 kHz in allocated RBs, measured in dBm.

The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of
the allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a
non?allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB. The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is
defined over one slot in the time domain.

6.5.2.3G	In-band emissions for non-allocated RB for V2X Communication
6.5.2.3G.1	In-band emissions for non-allocated RB for V2X Communication / Non-concurrent
with E-UTRA uplink transmissions
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	Test mode of side link State [5A-V2X] in 36.508 is FFS.
-	The test tolerance is left FFS for carrier frequency operating on band 47 f > 5GHz
-	PSBCH is left TBD
6.5.2.3G.1.1	Test Purpose
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-allocated resources blocks, this is to verify
that the inband emissions of V2X sidelink non-concurrent with E-UTRAN uplink transmissions satisfy the minimum
requirements listed in 6.5.2.3G.1.3.
6.5.2.3G.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that supports V2X communication and is
capable of V2X sidelink communication.
6.5.2.3G.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of
the allocated sidelink transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in
a non?allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB.
The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain When V2X transmissions
are shortened due to transmission gap of 1 symbol at the end of the subframe, the In-band emissions measurement
interval is reduced by one symbol, accordingly.
For V2X sidelink physical channels PSCCH, PSSCH and PSBCH, the In-band emissions requirements shall be as
specified for PUSCH in subclause 36.101[2] 6.5.2.3 for the corresponding modulation and transmission bandwidth. For
intra-band contiguous multi-carrier operation the in-band emission requirement of subclause 36.101 [2] 6.5.2.3 shall
apply for each component carrier.
Consequently, the relative in-band emission of each sidelink physical channel shall not exceed the values specified in
Tables 6.5.2.3G.1.3.

NOTE 1:	An in-band emissions combined limit is evaluated in each non-allocated RB. For each such RB, the
minimum requirement is calculated as the higher of PRB - 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values
(General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply. PRB is defined in NOTE 10.
NOTE 2:	The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in one non-
allocated RB to the measured average power per allocated RB, where the averaging is done across all
allocated RBs. For Frame Structure Type 3 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth, the requirement applies with
  for any non-allocated RB and in the uplink scheduling grant with  specified in [6].
NOTE 3:	The applicable frequencies for this limit are those that are enclosed in the reflection of the allocated
bandwidth, based on symmetry with respect to the centre carrier frequency, but excluding any allocated
RBs. For Frame Structure Type 3 with 20 MHz channel bandwidth, the applicable frequency is  .
NOTE 4:	The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in one non-
allocated RB to the measured total power in all allocated RBs. For Frame Structure Type 3 and 20 MHz
channel bandwidth, the requirement applies with in the uplink scheduling grant.
NOTE 5:	The applicable frequencies for this limit are those that are enclosed in the RBs containing the DC
frequency if   is odd, or in the two RBs immediately adjacent to the DC frequency if   is even, but
excluding any allocated RB.
NOTE 6:	  is the Transmission Bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1).
NOTE 7:	  is the Transmission Bandwidth Configuration (see Figure 5.6-1).
NOTE 8:	  is the limit specified in Table 6.5.2.1.1-1 for the modulation format used in the allocated RBs.
NOTE 9:	  is the starting frequency offset between the allocated RB and the measured non-allocated RB (e.g.
  or   for the first adjacent RB outside of the allocated bandwidth.
NOTE 10:	  is the transmitted power per 180 kHz in allocated RBs, measured in dBm.
[NOTE 11:	For V2V-V2X waveforms, the requirements are applied when PSSCH and PSCCH are adjacent in

6.5.2.4	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
6.5.2.4.1	Test Purpose
The zero-forcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process (as described in Annex E) must meet a
spectrum flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined
in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block
variation in dB of the equalizer coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process. The EVM equalizer spectrum
flatness requirement does not limit the correction applied to the signal in the EVM measurement process but for the
EVM result to be valid, the equalizer correction that was applied must meet the EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
minimum requirements. The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.
6.5.2.4.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
6.5.2.4.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained within the frequency range of the uplink
allocation shall not exceed the maximum ripple. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.5.2.4.3-1 for normal conditions. For uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2,
the coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding ripple requirement and
the following additional requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 1 and the
minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 5 dB, and the relative difference between the maximum
coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 7 dB (see Figure 6.5.2.4.3-1).
The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.5.2.4.3-2 for extreme conditions.
For uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients evaluated within each of these
frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional requirement: the relative
difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger
than 6 dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient in
Range 1 must not be larger than 10 dB (see Figure 6.5.2.4.3-1).

6.5.2.4G	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness for V2X transmission
6.5.2.4G.1	Spectrum Emission Mask for V2X Communication / Non-concurrent with E-UTRA
uplink transmissions
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-		The test tolerance is left FFS for carrier frequency operating on band 47 f > 5GHz
-	The test mode of Side link [5A-V2X] is FFS;
6.5.2.4G.1.1	Test Purpose
The zero-forcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process (as described in Annex E) must meet a
spectrum flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined
in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the V2X sidelink allocated block
variation in dB of the equalizer coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process. The EVM equalizer spectrum
flatness requirement does not limit the correction applied to the signal in the EVM measurement process but for the
EVM result to be valid, the equalizer correction that was applied must meet the EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
minimum requirements. The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.
6.5.2.4G.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward that supports V2X communication.
6.5.2.4G.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained within the frequency range of the V2X sidelink
allocation shall not exceed the maximum ripple. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.5.2.4G.1.3-1 for normal conditions. For V2X sidelink allocations contained within both Range 1
and Range 2, the coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding ripple
requirement and the following additional requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 5 dB, and the relative difference between the
maximum coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 7 dB (see Figure
6.5.2.4G.1.3-1).
The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.5.2.4G.1.3-2 for extreme
conditions. For uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients evaluated within each of
these frequency ranges shall meet the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional requirement: the
relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be
larger than 6 dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient
in Range 1 must not be larger than 10 dB (see Figure 6.5.2.4G.1.3-1).
For intra-band contiguous multi-carrier operation the above EVM equalizer spectrum flatness requirement shall apply
for each component carrier.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration
which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first
of those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channel is set according to Table 6.5.2A.1.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause [5.2A.2]. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.5.2A.1.1.4.3.
6.5.2A.1.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	The frequencies of PCC and SCC shall be switched and tested in each configuration.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1, and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL RMC is set according to Table 6.5.2A.1.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.5.2A.1.2.4.3.
6.5.2A.1.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.5.2A.3.2.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.5.2A.1.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the EVM and   on PCC using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E).
7.	Send the appropriate TPC commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until UE output power is ?
36.8dBm ±3.2dB for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz or -36.5dBm ±3.5 dB for carrier frequency 3.0GHz < f ≤
4.2GHz.
8.	Measure the EVM and   on PCC using Global In-Channel Tx-Test (Annex E).

6.5.2A.3	In-band emissions for non allocated RB for CA
6.5.2A.3.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the requirements shall apply on each
component carrier as defined in clause 6.5.2 with all component carriers active. If two contiguous component carriers
are assigned to one E-UTRA band, the requirements in subclauses 6.5.2A.1, 6.5.2A.2, and 6.5.2A.3 apply for those
component carriers.
The requirements in this clause apply with PCC and SCC in the UL configured and activated: PCC with PRB allocation
and SCC without PRB allocation and without CSI reporting and SRS configured.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation bandwidth class B and C, the requirements in Table 6.5.2A.3.0-1 and
6.5.2A.3.0-2 apply within the aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration with both component carrier (s) active
and one single contiguous PRB allocation of bandwidth  at the edge of the aggregated transmission bandwidth
configuration.
The inband emission is defined as the interference falling into the non allocated resource blocks for all component
carriers. The measurement method for the inband emissions in the component carrier with PRB allocation is specified in
annex F. For a non allocated component carrier a spectral measurement is specified.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the requirements for in-band emissions should be defined for each
component carrier. Requirements only apply with PRB allocation in one of the component carriers according to Table
6.5.2.3.3.

NOTE 1:	An in-band emissions combined limit is evaluated in each non-allocated RB. For each such RB, the
minimum requirement is calculated as the higher of PRB - 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values
(General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply. PRB is defined in NOTE 9. The limit is evaluated in each
non-allocated RB.
NOTE 2:	The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in one non-
allocated RB to the measured average power per allocated RB, where the averaging is done across all
allocated RBs
NOTE 3:	Exceptions to the general limit are allowed for up to   +1 RBs within a contiguous width of   +1
non-allocated RBs. The measurement bandwidth is 1 RB.
NOTE 4:	Exceptions to the general limit are allowed for up to two contiguous non-allocated RBs. The measurement
bandwidth is 1 RB and the limit is expressed as a ratio of measured power in the non-allocated RB to the

6.5.2A.3.1	In-band emissions for non allocated RB for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA)
6.5.2A.3.1.1	Test Purpose
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-allocated resources blocks.
For an allocated component carrier, the in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a
function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured
as the ratio of the UE output power in a non?allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB. The basic in-
band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH
transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced by
one SC-FDMA symbol, accordingly.
For a non allocated component carrier a spectral measurement is specified.
6.5.2A.3.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA.

6.5.2B	Transmit modulation for UL- MIMO
6.5.2B.1	Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for UL- MIMO
6.5.2B.1.1	Test Purpose
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured
waveform. This difference is called the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected
by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured
waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain.
The EVM result is defined after the front-end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.
When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the EVM measurement
interval is reduced by one symbol, accordingly. The PUSCH or PUCCH EVM measurement interval is also reduced
when the mean power, modulation or allocation between slots is expected to change. In the case of PUSCH
transmission, the measurement interval is reduced by a time interval equal to the sum of 5 μs and the applicable
exclusion period defined in subclause 6.3.4, adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur. The
PUSCH exclusion period is applied to the signal obtained after the front-end IDFT. In the case of PUCCH transmission,
the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the slot boundary.
6.5.2B.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.5.2B.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the Error Vector Magnitude
requirements specified in Table 6.5.2.1.1-1 which is defined in sub-clause 6.5.2.1 apply to each transmit antenna
connector with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2.

6.5.2B.3	In-band emissions for non allocated RB for UL-MIMO
6.5.2B.3.1	Test Purpose
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-allocated resources blocks.
The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of
the allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission for UL-MIMO is measured as the ratio of the output
power of UE that support UL-MIMO in a non?allocated RB to the output power of UE that support UL-MIMO in an
allocated RB. The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain. When the
PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement
interval is reduced by one SC-FDMA symbol, accordingly.
6.5.2B.3.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.5.2B.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements

6.5.2B.4	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness for UL-MIMO
6.5.2B.4.1	Test Purpose
The zero-forcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process (as described in Annex E) must meet a
spectrum flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined
in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block
variation in dB of the equalizer coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process. The EVM equalizer spectrum
flatness requirement does not limit the correction applied to the signal in the EVM measurement process but for the
EVM result to be valid, the equalizer correction that was applied must meet the EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
minimum requirements. The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.
6.5.2B.4.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.5.2B.4.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the EVM Equalizer Spectrum
Flatness requirements specified in Table 6.5.2B.4.3-1 and Table 6.5.2B.4.3-2 which are defined in sub-clause 6.5.2B.4
apply to each transmit antenna connector with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 clause 6.5.2B.4.
6.5.2B.4.4	Test description

6.6	Output RF spectrum emissions
Unwanted emissions are divided into "Out-of-band emission" and "Spurious emissions" in 3GPP RF specifications.
This notation is in line with ITU-R recommendations such as SM.329 ??[2] and the Radio Regulations ?[3].
ITU defines:
Out-of-band emission = Emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which
results from the modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emission = Emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level
of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. Spurious emissions include
harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude out-
of-band emissions.
Unwanted emissions = Consist of spurious emissions and out-of-band emissions.
The UE transmitter spectrum emission consists of the three components; the occupied bandwidth (channel bandwidth),
the Out Of Band (OOB) emissions and the far out spurious emission domain.

6.6.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth configurations supported by the UE are less
than their specific limits
6.6.1.2	Test applicability

6.6.1.2	Minimum conformance requirements
Occupied bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated mean power of the
transmitted spectrum on the assigned channel. The occupied channel bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth

1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via NPDCCH DCI format N0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.6.1F.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink
MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. (UE should be already transmitting PUMAX after Initial Conditions setting).
2.	Measure the power spectrum distribution within two times or more range over the requirement for Occupied
Bandwidth specification centring on the current carrier frequency. The characteristic of the filter shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filter). Other methods to measure the power spectrum
distribution are allowed. The measurement duration is at least one sub-frame (1ms) for 15 KHz channel spacing,
and at least a 2ms slot (excluding the 2304Ts gap when UE is not transmitting) respectively for the 3.75 KHz
channel spacing.
3.	Calculate the total power within the range of all frequencies measured in '2)' and save this value as "Total
Power".
4.	Sum up the power upward from the lower boundary of the measured frequency range in '2)' and seek the limit
frequency point by which this sum becomes 0,5 % of "Total Power" and save this point as "Lower Frequency".
5.	Sum up the power downward from the upper boundary of the measured frequency range in '2)' and seek the limit
frequency point by which this sum becomes 0,5 % of "Total Power" and save this point as "Upper Frequency".

NOTE:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.6.2.1.

6.6.2.1A	Spectrum emission mask for CA
6.6.2.1A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the spectrum emission mask of the UE
is defined per component carrier while both component carriers are active and the requirements are specified in
subclauses 6.6.2.1.3 and 6.6.2.2.3. If for some frequency spectrum emission masks of component carriers overlap then
spectrum emission mask allowing higher power spectral density applies for that frequency. If for some frequency a
component carrier spectrum emission mask overlaps with the channel bandwidth of another component carrier, then the
emission mask does not apply for that frequency.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (ΔfOOB)
starting from the ? edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2A-1) For intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation the bandwidth class B and C, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table
6.6.2.1A.0-1 and Table 6.6.2.1A.0-2 for the specified channel bandwidth.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation transmission the spectrum emission mask requirement is defined as a
composite spectrum emissions mask. Composite spectrum emission mask applies to frequencies up to ? ΔfOOB starting
from the edges of the sub-blocks. Composite spectrum emission mask is defined as follows
a)	Composite spectrum emission mask is a combination of individual sub-block spectrum emissions masks
b)	In case the sub-block consist of one component carrier the sub-lock general spectrum emission mask is defined
in subclause 6.6.2.1.3
c)	If for some frequency sub-block spectrum emission masks overlap then spectrum emission mask allowing higher
power spectral density applies for that frequency
d)	If for some frequency a sub-block spectrum emission mask overlaps with the sub-block bandwidth of another
sub-block, then the emission mask does not apply for that frequency.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1A.

NOTE:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

6.6.2.1A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.2.1A.1.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.6.2.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power for each CC, which shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2.3A.2.5-1. The
period of the measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.
7.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for PCC with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to table
6.6.2.1A.2.5-1 or 6.6.2.1A.2.5-2, as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in continuous
steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The measurement period
shall capture the active TSs.
8.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for SCC with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to table
6.6.2.1A.2.5-1 or 6.6.2.1A.2.5-2, as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in continuous
steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The measurement period
shall capture the active TSs.
6.6.2.1A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there are no
additional message contents.
6.6.2.1A.2.5	Test Requirements
Editor's note:	Need further investigation for test requirements in case some frequency spectrum emission masks of
component carriers overlap for future coming inter-band UL CA combinations
The measured UE mean power in the channel bandwidth for each CC, derived in step 6, shall fulfil requirements in
Table 6.2.3A.2.5-1 as appropriate, and the power of any UE emission per component carrier derived in step 7 and 8
shall fulfil requirements in Table.6.6.2.1A.2.5-1 or Table.6.6.2.1A.2.5-2, as applicable.

Note 1:	The first and last measurement position with a 30 kHz filter is at ΔfOOB equals to
0.015 MHz and 0.985 MHz.
Note 2:	At the boundary of spectrum emission limit, the first and last measurement
position with a 1 MHz filter is the inside of +0.5MHz and -0.5MHz, respectively.
Note 3:	The measurements are to be performed above the upper edge of the channel
and below the lower edge of the channel
Note 4:	For the 2.5-2.8 MHz offset range with 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth, the
measurement position is at ΔfOOB equals to 3 MHz.

NOTE:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.6.2.2.2.

6.6.2.2.4	Test description
6.6.2.2.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Tables 6.6.2.2.4.1-1 through 6.6.2.2.4.1-10. The details of the uplink
reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2 respectively. Configurations of PDSCH and
PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

applicability of the UE.
Note 2:	Applies only for UE-Categories ≥2.
Note 3:	The 16QAM configurations shall not apply to UEs which support UL 64QAM.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 6.6.2.2.4.1-1 to 6.6.2.2.4.1-10.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.2.2.4.3.
6.6.2.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to applicable table from Table 6.6.2.2.4.1-1 to 6.6.2.2.4.1-10. Since the UE has
no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2.4.5-1 to 6.2.4.5-27 or 6.2.4_1.5-1 as
appropriate. The period of the measurement shall be at least one sub-frame (1ms).
4.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.2.2.5.1-1, 6.6.2.2.5.2-1, 6.6.2.2.5.3-1 or Table 6.6.2.2.5.1-2, 6.6.2.2.5.2-2, 6.6.2.2.5.3-2, or 6.6.2.2.5.4-1 as
applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in continuous steps according to the same table.
The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
6.6.2.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6, with the following exceptions for each network
signalled value.
6.6.2.2.4.3.1	Message contents exceptions (network signalled value "NS_03")

NOTE:	(only for emission measurement) As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity
and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.

NOTE:	(only for emission measurement) As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity
and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.

Note 1:	The Configuration ID will be used to map the applicable Test Configuration to the
corresponding Test Requirement in subclause 6.2.4_3.5 as not all combinations are
necessarily required based on the applicability of the UE.
Note 2:	The RBstart of partial RB allocation shall be RB# 0 of the channel bandwidth.
Note 3:	High range test frequency to be used.
Note 4:	Low range test frequency to be used.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.3.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The DL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.2.2_2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.2.2.4.3.
6.6.2.2_2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 with hopping
bit(s) set to 1 (PUSCH type 2 hopping) for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to the applicable Table
6.6.2.2_2.4.1-1. SS sends always NACK on PHICH to trigger UE retransmissions needed for mirroring of RBs.
Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode in a TTI. The period of
measurement shall be one sub-frame (1ms) excluding the 20 us transient periods in beginning and end of the
subframe.
4.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode in the next TTI of the
same HARQ process. The period of measurement shall be one sub-frame (1ms) excluding the 20 us transient
periods in beginning and end of the subframe.
5.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Tables
6.6.2.2.5-1 to 6.6.2.2.5-6, as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in continuous steps
according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The measurement period shall
capture the active TSs excluding the 20 us transient periods in beginning and end of the subframe. The
measurement period shall include at least two consecutive UL TTI’s.

Note 1:	The first and last measurement position with a 30 kHz filter is at ΔfOOB equals to 0.015
MHz and 0.985 MHz.
Note 2:	At the boundary of spectrum emission limit, the first and last measurement position with
a 1 MHz filter is the inside of +0.5MHz and -0.5MHz, respectively.
Note 3:	The measurements are to be performed above the upper edge of the channel and
below the lower edge of the channel
Note 4:	Above SEM requirement applies to bands corresponding to network signalling value
CA_NS_04 as defined in TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.6.2.2A Table 6.2.2.2A-1.

NOTE:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

Note 4:	Applicable only to Low range frequency testing.
Note 5:	Applicable only to High range frequency testing.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.2.2A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.2.2A.2.4.1-9.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.2.2A.2.4.3.
6.6.2.2A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.2.2A.2.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.6.2.2A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.2.2A.2.4.1-9 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload data
to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access mode, which
shall meet the requirements described in Tables 6.2.4A.2.5-2 to 6.2.4A.2.5-12. The period of the measurement
shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are not
under test.
7.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for PCC if NS-value other than NS_01 with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to tables 6.6.2.2A.2.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.2A.2.5.1-4 as applicable. The centre frequency of the
filter shall be stepped in continuous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for
each step. The measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
8.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for SCC if NS-value other than NS_01 with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to tables 6.6.2.2A.2.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.2A.2.5.1-4 as applicable. The centre frequency of the
filter shall be stepped in continuous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for
each step. The measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
6.6.2.2A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6. The following exceptions apply for each network signalled
value. These exceptions indicate that the UE shall meet the additional spectrum emission requirement for a specific

NOTE:	(only for emission measurement) As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity
and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.2.2A.3.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.2.2A.3.4.3.
6.6.2.2A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.2.2A.3.4.3.
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.6.2.2A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the CA configuration of the radio access mode, which
shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2.3A.3.5-1. The period of the measurement shall be at least the
continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are not under test.
7.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for PCC with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to
tables 6.6.2.2A.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.2A.3.5.1-2 as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
continuous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The
measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
8.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal for SCC with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to
tables 6.6.2.2A.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.2A.3.5.1-2 as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
continuous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step. The
measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
6.6.2.2A.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6. The following exceptions apply for each network signalled
value. These exceptions indicate that the UE shall meet the additional spectrum emission requirement for a specific
deployment scenario.

Note 5:	For the 2.5-2.8 MHz offset range with 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth, the
measurement position is at ΔfOOB equals to 3 MHz.

NOTE:	(only for emission measurement) As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity
and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.

6.6.2.2EA.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to applicable table from Table 6.6.2.2EA.4.1-1 to 6.6.2.2.4EA.1-4.
Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
4.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2.4EA.5-1 to 6.2.4EA.5-9 as appropriate.
The period of the measurement shall be at least one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are
not under test. For HD-FDD slots with transient periods and Half-duplex guard subframe are not under test
5.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.2.2EA.5.1-1, 6.6.2.2EA.5.2-1 and, 6.6.2.2.5EA.3-1 as applicable. The centre frequency of the filter shall be
stepped in continuous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be recorded for each step.
The measurement period shall capture the active TSs.
6.6.2.2EA.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are same as in clause 6.2.4EA.4.3.

with E-UTRA uplink transmissions
Editor's note:	This test case is not complete. Following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
-	The clause number of reference to measurement average power of channel bandwidth is left TBD.
-	Network signal for additional spectrum emission of NS_33 is still open in RAN2
-	Test tolerance is open
-	The clause number of reference to test mode in 36.508 is left TBD.
6.6.2.2G.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that the power of V2X UE emission shall not exceed specified level for the specified channel bandwidth
under the deployment scenarios where additional requirements are specified.
6.6.2.2G.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to E-UTRA UE release 14 and forward which support V2X communication.
6.6.2.2G.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
The additional spectrum mask in Table 6.6.2.2G.1.3-1 applies for E-UTRA V2X UE within 5855 MHz to 5950 MHz
according to ETSI EN 302 571. Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network to indicate that
the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message.

NOTE 1:	As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
NOTE 2:	Additional SEM for V2X overrides any other requirements in frequency range 5855-5950MHz.

Figure 6.6.2.3A.0-1.

Figure 6.6.2.3A.0-1: Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio for CA requirements

6.6.2.3A.0.1	Minimum requirement UTRA for CA
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel bandwidth on the
component carrier to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The UTRA Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio is defined per carrier and the requirement is specified in subclause 6.6.2.3.3.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (UTRAACLR) is the
ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the aggregated channel bandwidth to the filtered mean power centred on an
adjacent(s) UTRA channel frequency.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation when all sub-blocks consist of one component carrier the UTRA
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean powers centred on the
assigned sub-block frequencies to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent(s) UTRA channel frequency.
UTRAACLR1/2 requirements are applicable for all sub-blocks and are specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.1-2. UTRAACLR1 is
required to be met in the sub-block gap when the gap bandwidth Wgap is 5MHz≤Wgap <15MHz. Both UTRAACLR1 and
UTRAACLR2 are required to be met in the sub-block gap when the gap bandwidth Wgap is 15MHz≤Wgap.
UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio is specified for both the first UTRA adjacent channel (UTRAACLR1) and
the 2nd UTRA adjacent channel (UTRAACLR2). The UTRA channel power is measured with a RRC bandwidth filter with
roll-off factor ??=0.22. The assigned aggregated channel bandwidth power is measured with a rectangular filter with
measurement bandwidth specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.1-1 for intraband contiguous carrier aggregation or 6.6.2.3A.0.1-
2 for intraband non-contiguous carrier aggregation. If the measured UTRA channel power is greater than ?50dBm then
the UTRAACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.1-1 for intraband contiguous carrier
aggregation or 6.6.2.3A.0.1-2 for intraband non-contiguous carrier aggregation.

6.6.2.3A.0.2	Minimum requirements for CA E-UTRA
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the carrier aggregation E-UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio
(CA E-UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the aggregated channel bandwidth to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent aggregated channel bandwidth at nominal channel spacing. The assigned aggregated
channel bandwidth power and adjacent aggregated channel bandwidth power are measured with rectangular filters with
measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.2-1. If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than ?
50dBm then the E-UTRAACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.2-1.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, E-UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (E-UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel bandwidth on a
component carrier to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The E-UTRA Adjacent
Channel Leakage power Ratio is defined per carrier and the requirement is specified in subclause 6.6.2.3.1.
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation when all sub-blocks consist of one component carrier the E-UTRA
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (E-UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean powers centred on
the assigned sub-block frequencies to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal
channel spacing. In case the sub-block gap bandwidth Wgap is smaller than of the sub-block bandwidth then for that
sub-block no E-UTRAACLR requirement is set for the gap. In case the sub-block gab bandwidth Wgap is smaller than
either of the sub-block bandwidths then no E- UTRAACLR requirement is set for the gap. The assigned E-UTRA sub-
block power and adjacent E-UTRA channel power are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths
specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.2-2. If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than ?50dBm then the E-
UTRAACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.2.3A.0.2-2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.2.3A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.2.3A.1.4.3.
6.6.2.3A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause

least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.2.3A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power over all component carriers of the UE in the CA configuration of the radio access mode
according to the test configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Table 6.2.3A.1.5-1. The
period of the measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.

Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg. only the
first of those is tested. according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	For Low range place test point with RBstart=0. For High range place test point with RBstart=RBmax-
LCRB+1.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.32 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.2.3A.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.2.3A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power of the component carrier of the UE in the first band of the CA configuration of the

Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) for UL-MIMO.
6.6.2.3B.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.6.2.3B.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements for ACLR are specified at each transmit antenna
connector. ACLR requirements are specified for two scenarios for an adjacent E -UTRAACLR and UTRAACLR1/2 as
shown in Figure 6.6.2.3B.3-1.

Figure 6.6.2.3B.3-1: Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio requirements

6.6.2.3B.3.1	Minimum conformance requirements for E-UTRA
E-UTRA ACLR (E-UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to
the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel spacing. The assigned E-UTRA
channel power and adjacent E-UTRA channel power are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidth
specified in Table 6.6.2.3B.3.1-1.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme ,, the requirements in Table
6.6.2.3B.3.1-1 apply to each transmit antenna connector with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in
Table 6.2.2B.3-2.
If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than -50dBm then the E-UTRAACLR shall be higher than the valued
specified in Table 6.6.2.3B.3.1-1.

6.6.2.3B.3.2	Minimum conformance requirements for UTRA
UTRA ACLR (UTRAACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned E-UTRA channel frequency
to the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent UTRA channel frequency.
UTRA ACLR is specified for both the first UTRA adjacent channel (UTRAACLR1) and the 2nd UTRA adjacent
channel (UTRAACLR2).The UTRA channel power is measured with a RRC bandwidth filter with roll-off factor ??=
0.22. The assigned E-UTRA channel power is measured with a rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth specified
in Table 6.6.2.3B.3.2-1.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the requirements in Table
6.6.2.3B.3.2-1 apply to each transmit antenna connector with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in
Table 6.2.2B.3-2.

6.6.2.4	Void
6.6.3	Spurious emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission,
parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The spurious emission limits are specified in terms of general requirements inline with SM.329 [3] and E-UTRA
operating band requirement to address UE co-existence.
Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than ΔfOOB (MHz) in
Table6.6.3.1.3-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth. To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency,
the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller
than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
6.6.3.1	Transmitter Spurious emissions
6.6.3.1.1	Test purpose
To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference to other channels or other systems in terms of
transmitter spurious emissions.
6.6.3.1.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 8 and forward.
6.6.3.1.3	Minimum conformance requirements
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified E-UTRA band for Transmitter Spurious emissions requirement
with frequency range as indicated in table 6.6.3.1.3-2.
The spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than ΔfOOB (MHz) from the edge of the
channel bandwidth.
NOTE:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the measurement
position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the highest
boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the
protected band.

6.6.3.1A	Transmitter Spurious emissions for CA
6.6.3.1A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
This clause specifies the spurious emission requirements for carrier aggregation.
NOTE 1:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the
measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency
range plus MBW/2. The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined for the protected band.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the spurious emission requirement Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 apply for the frequency ranges that are more than FOOB as defined in Table 6.6.3.1.3-1 away from edges of
the assigned channel bandwidth on a component carrier. If for some frequency a spurious emission requirement of
individual component carrier overlaps with the spectrum emission mask or channel bandwidth of another component
carrier then it does not apply.
NOTE 2:	For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands the requirements in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 could be verified by measuring spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second
and third order intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted carriers can occur; in that case,
the requirements for remaining applicable frequencies in Table 6.6.3.1.3-2 would be considered to be
verified by the measurements verifying the one uplink inter-band CA spurious emission requirement.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more
than FOOB (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth (Table 5.4.2A-1). For
frequencies ΔfOOB greater than FOOB as specified in Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1the spurious emission requirements in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are applicable.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation transmission the spurious emission requirement is defined as a
composite spurious emission requirement. Composite spurious emission requirement applies to frequency ranges that
are more than FOOB away from the edges of the sub-blocks. Composite spurious emission requirement is defined as
follows
a)	Composite spurious emission requirement is a combination of individual sub-block spurious emission
requirements
b)	In case the sub-block consist of one component carrier the sub-lock spurious emission requirement and FOOB are
defined in subclause 6.6.3.1.3
c)	If for some frequency an individual sub-block spurious emission requirement overlaps with the general spectrum
emission mask or the sub-block bandwidth of another sub-block then it does not apply

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-2.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of
those is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

-	Instead of Table 6.6.3.1A.1.5-1 --> use Table 6.6.3.1A.2.5-1.
-	Instead of clause 6.6.3.1A.1.4.3 use clause 6.6.3.1A.2.4.3.
6.6.3.1A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6 with exceptions as in clause 6.6.3.1A.1.4.3.
6.6.3.1A.2.5	Test requirement
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified E-UTRA band for Transmitter Spurious emissions requirement
with frequency range as indicated in table 6.6.3.1A.2.5-1.
For frequencies ΔfOOB greater than FOOB as specified in Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1the measured average power of spurious
emission, derived in step 6, shall not exceed the described value in Table 6.6.3.1A.2.5-1.
NOTE:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the
measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency
range plus MBW/2. The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined for the protected band.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-3.
Note 2:	The measurements need to be executed for in-gap interferer positions when the sub-block gap size Wgap
allows.

6.6.3.1A.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.3.1A.3.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.1A.3.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3.1A.3.5-1 for each component carrier. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps
according to Table 6.6.3.1A.3.5-1. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period
shall capture the active time slots.
7.	Repeat the measurement for in-gap interferer positions when the sub-block gap size Wgap allows.
6.6.3.1A.3.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there
are no additional message contents.
6.6.3.1A.3.5	Test Requirements
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified E-UTRA band for Transmitter Spurious emissions requirement
with frequency range as indicated in table 6.6.3.1A.3.5-1.
For frequencies ΔfOOB greater than FOOB as specified in Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1the measured average power of spurious
emission, derived in step 6, shall not exceed the described value in Table 6.6.3.1A.3.5-1.
NOTE:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the
measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency
range plus MBW/2. The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined for the protected band.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table 6.6.3.1.3-2 are
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd or 3rd harmonic spurious
emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RE within the transmission bandwidth (see
Figure 5.4.2-1) for which the 2nd or 3rd harmonic, i.e. the frequency equal to two or three times the frequency
of that RE, is within the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or protected band
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the
operating band or protected band
Note 6:	N/A.
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
Note 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5-1915.7MHz.
Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation < 0.5 dB
Note 13:	Applicable when UE transmits anywhere within 1749.9 ? 1784.9MHz.Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA
UL operating channel is ≥1 749.9MHz and ≤ 1 784.9MHz.
Note 14:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than ΔfOOB (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1.3-1
from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
Note 15:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20
MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the range
2500 - 2570 MHz.
Note 16:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20
MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2597 ? 2605 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the range
2570 ? 2615 MHz. For assigned carriers with bandwidths overlapping the frequency range 2615-2620 MHz the
requirements apply with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
Note 17:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20
MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the range
1920 - 1980 MHz.
Note 18:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to UE(s) operating in the
protected operating band.

NOTE:	The restriction on the maximum uplink transmission to 54 RB in Notes 15, 16, and 17 of Table 6.6.3.2.3-
1 is intended for conformance testing and may be applied to network operation to facilitate coexistence
when the aggressor and victim bands are deployed in the same geographical area. The applicable spurious
emission requirement of -15.5 dBm/5MHz is a least restrictive technical condition for FDD/TDD
coexistence and may have to be revised in the future.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table 6.6.3.1.3-2 are
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd or 3rd harmonic spurious
emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RE within the transmission bandwidth
(see Figure 5.4.2-1) for which the 2nd or 3rd harmonic, i.e. the frequency equal to two or three times the
frequency of that RE, is within the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or protected band
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either
the operating band or protected band
Note 6:	N/A
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
Note 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:		The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation < 0.5 dB
Note 13:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA UL operating channel is ≥1744.9MHz and ≤ 1784.9MHz.
Note 14:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than ΔfOOB (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1-1
from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
Note 15:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of
20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the
range 2500 - 2570 MHz.
Note 16:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of
20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2597 ? 2605 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the
range 2570 ? 2615 MHz. For assigned carriers with bandwidths overlapping the frequency range 2615-2620
MHz the requirements apply with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
Note 17:	For carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth with carrier centre frequencies (Fc) in the range 902.5MHz ≤ Fc <
907.5 MHz, the requirement applies for uplink transmission bandwidths less than or equal to 20 RB. No
restrictions apply in the range 907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth, the
requirement only applies for Fc = 910 MHz and uplink transmission bandwidths less than or equal to 32 RB
with RBstart > 3.
Note 18:	This requirement is applicable for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of
20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz. This requirement is
applicable without any other uplink transmission bandwidth restriction for channel bandwidths within the
range 1920 - 1980 MHz.
Note 19:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to UE(s) operating in the
protected operating band.

NOTE:	The restriction on the maximum uplink transmission to 54 RB in Notes 15, 16 and 18 of Table 6.6.3.2.3-
1A is intended for conformance testing and may be applied to network operation to facilitate coexistence
when the aggressor and victim bands are deployed in the same geographical area. The applicable spurious
emission requirement of -15.5 dBm/5MHz is a least restrictive technical condition for FDD/TDD
coexistence and may have to be revised in the future.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table 6.6.3.1.3-2 are
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th ] harmonic
spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This
results in an overall exception interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where
N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th ] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement
bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or protected band
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the

Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation < 0.5 dB
Note 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 1744.9MHz
and 1784.9MHz.
Note 14:	N/A
Note 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1.3-1 and
Table 6.6.3.1A.1.3-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
NOTE 16:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with the following
restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2560.5 - 2562.5
MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz
the requirement is applicable only for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with the following
restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2605.5 - 2607.5
MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz
the requirement is applicable only for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the requirement applies
with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
NOTE 18:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range 902.5 MHz ≤ Fc
< 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range 907.5 MHz ≤ Fc
≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 19:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with the following
restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1927.5 - 1929.5
MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz
the requirement is applicable only for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 20:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to UE(s) operating in the
protected operating band.
Note 21	N/A
Note 22	N/A

NOTE:	The restriction on the maximum uplink transmission to 54 RB in Notes 16, 17, and 19 of Table 6.6.3.2.3-
1B is intended for conformance testing and may be applied to network operation to facilitate coexistence
when the aggressor and victim bands are deployed in the same geographical area. The applicable spurious
emission requirement of -15.5 dBm/5MHz is a least restrictive technical condition for FDD/TDD
coexistence and may have to be revised in the future.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the
exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic
emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval
centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th ] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth
(MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band
Note 6:	N/A
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
Note 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
Note 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
Note 14:	N/A
Note 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1.3-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A.1.3-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
Note 16:	N/A
Note 17:	N/A
Note 18:	N/A
Note 19:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
Note 20:	N/A
Note 21:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
Note 23:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
Note 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 26:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
Note 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 28:	 N/A
Note 29:	 N/A
Note 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575 MHz and the
channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
Note 31:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.
Note 32:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the
exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic
emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval
centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th ] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth
(MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band
Note 6:	N/A
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
Note 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
Note 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
Note 14:	N/A
Note 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1.3-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A.1.3-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
Note 16:	N/A
Note 17:	N/A
Note 18:	N/A
Note 19:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
Note 20:	N/A
Note 21:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
Note 23	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
Note 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 26: For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
Note 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 28:	N/A
Note 29:	N/A
Note 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
Note 31:	N/A
Note 32:	Void.
Note 33:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to [54 RB] for carriers
of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and
for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903
MHz.
Note 34:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.
Note 35:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1.
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception
is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th]
harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or
partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band.
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band.
Note 6:	N/A
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
Note 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
Note 9:	N/A
Note 10:	N/A
Note 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
Note 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
Note 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
Note 14:	N/A
Note 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
Note 16:	N/A
Note 17:	N/A
Note 18:	N/A
Note 19:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
Note 20:	N/A
Note 21:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
Note 23:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
Note 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 26: For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
Note 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
Note 28:	N/A
Note 29:	N/A
Note 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz.
Note 31:	N/A
Note 32:	Void.
Note 33:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.
Note 34:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.
Note 35:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
Note 36:	This requirement is applicable for E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 1920-1980 MHz.
Note 37:	Applicable when the upper edge of the channel bandwidth frequency is greater than 1980MHz.
Note 38:	Applicable only for UE category M1 and NB1.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception
is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th]
harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or
partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band
NOTE 4:	N/A
NOTE 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band
NOTE 6:	N/A
NOTE 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 9:	N/A
NOTE 10:	N/A
NOTE 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
NOTE 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
NOTE 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 14:	N/A
NOTE 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
NOTE 16:	N/A
NOTE 17:	N/A

the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 26: For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 28:	N/A
NOTE 29:	N/A
NOTE 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 31:	N/A
NOTE 32:	Void
NOTE 33:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.
NOTE 34:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.
NOTE 35:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
NOTE 36:	This requirement is applicable for E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 1920-1980 MHz.
NOTE 37:	Applicable when the upper edge of the channel bandwidth frequency is greater than 1980MHz.
NOTE 38:	Applicable when NS_XX is configured by the pre-configured radio parameters.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.6.3.2.
This test use minimum requirements from many releases of TS 36.101 [2] due to release independence defined in TS
36.307 [16]
6.6.3.2.4	Test description
6.6.3.2.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Table 6.6.3.2.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.7.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.3.2.4.3.
6.6.3.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to table
6.6.3.2.3-1 to 6.6.3.2.3-1E. For band 14 measurements made in a bandwidth of 6.25kHz, measurement parameter
settings defined in table 6.6.3.2.4.2-1 shall be used. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
contiguous steps according to table 6.6.3.2.5-1. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The
measurement period shall capture the active time slots.

6.6.3.2.5	Test requirement
Test requirements for Spurious Emissions UE Co-existence are the same as the minimum requirements and are not
repeated in this section.
The measured average power of spurious emission, derived in step 3, shall not exceed the described value in
tables 6.6.3.2.3-1 to 6.6.3.2.3-1E according to the following rule:
The requirements for the UE are release specific and can be found in Tables 6.6.3.2.3-1 to 6.6.3.2.3-1E. If the UE
support a band, which is not defined in the table corresponding UE’s release, the requirements for this band are taken
from the table of earliest release where requirements for this band are defined. This has been described in following
Table 6.6.3.2.5-1.

Note 1:	Operating band with number > 64 requires Rel-9 signalling (refer to TS
36.307 Ch. 3A.1 [16]) and tests can only be done from Rel-9 and onwards.
Note 2:	Asymmetric operating band is release independent from release 10 (refer to
TS 36.307 Ch. 3A.1 [16]) and tests can only be done from Rel-10 and
onwards.
Note 3:	Protected bands with Note 38 in Table 6.6.3.2.3-1E are tested in 6.6.3EA.2
or 6.6.3F.2.


NOTE 1:	The frequency range applicable with network signalled values of NS_05, NS_08, NS_09, NS_15,NS_16
and NS_27 are covered in 6.6.3.3 Additional Spurious Emissions.
NOTE 2:	The following is applied to Note2 in Table 6.6.3.2.3-1, Table 6.6.3.2.3-1A, Table 6.6.3.2.3-1B, Table
6.6.3.2.3-1C and Table 6.6.3.2.3-1E. For frequency with 2nd, 3rd or 4th harmonic spurious emissions, the
measurements are covered in 6.6.3.1.
NOTE 2:	The restriction on the maximum uplink transmission to 54 RB in Notes 14 and 15 of Table 6.6.3.2.5-1 is
intended for conformance testing and may be applied to network operation to facilitate coexistence when
the aggressor and victim bands are deployed in the same geographical area. The applicable spurious
emission requirement of -15.5 dBm/5MHz is a least restrictive technical condition for FDD/TDD
coexistence and may have to be revised in the future.
6.6.3.2_1	Void
6.6.3.2A	Spurious emission band UE co-existence for CA
Editor's note: This test case contains different requirements for different UE releases
6.6.3.2A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified carrier aggregation configurations for coexistence with protected
bands.
NOTE 1:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the
measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency
range plus MBW/2. The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined for the protected band.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the requirements in Table
6.6.3.2A.0-1a to 6.6.3.2A.0-1c apply on each component carrier with both component carriers are active.
NOTE 2:	For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands the requirements in Table
6.6.3.2A.0-1a to 6.6.3.2A.0-1c could be verified by measuring spurious emissions at the specific
frequencies where second and third order intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted
carriers can occur; in that case, the requirements for remaining applicable frequencies in Table
6.6.3.2A.0-1a to 6.6.3.2A.0-1c would be considered to be verified by the measurements verifying the one
uplink inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence requirements.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one
individual RB within the transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.4.2-1) for which the 2nd, 3rd or 4th
harmonic totally or partially overlaps the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 3:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1.3-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
NOTE 4:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 5:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 6:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 7:	Applicable when NS_05 in section 6.6.3.3.3.2 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when NS_08 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.4 is signalled by the network
NOTE 9:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD.
NOTE10:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 11:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 12:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE13:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 14:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 15:	Applicable when NS_15 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.10 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 16:	Applicable when NS_09 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.5 is signalled by the network
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable only when Band 3 transmission frequency is less than or equal to
1765 MHz.
NOTE 18:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 19:	Void.
NOTE 20:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. In case the exceptions are allowed due to spreading of
the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range
immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in
an overall exception interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz),
where N is 2, 3 or 4 for the 2nd, 3rd or 4th harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the
measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
NOTE 4:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 5:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 6:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 7:	Applicable when NS_05 in section 6.6.3.3.3.2 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when NS_08 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.4 is signalled by the network
NOTE 9:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD.
NOTE10:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 11:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 12:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE13:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 14:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 15:	Applicable when NS_15 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.10 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 16:	Applicable when NS_09 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.5 is signalled by the network
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable only when Band 3 transmission frequency is less than or equal to
1765 MHz.
NOTE 18:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 19:	Void.
NOTE 20:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to [54 RB] for carriers
of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and
for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903
MHz.
NOTE 21:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. In case the exceptions are allowed due to spreading of
the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range
immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in
an overall exception interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz),
where N is 2, 3 or 4 for the 2nd, 3rd or 4th harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the
measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
NOTE 4:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 5:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 6:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 7:	Applicable when NS_05 in section 6.6.3.3.3.2 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when NS_08 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.4 is signalled by the network
NOTE 9:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD.
NOTE10:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 11:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 12:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE13:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 14:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 15:	Applicable when NS_15 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.10 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 16:	Applicable when NS_09 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.5 is signalled by the network
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable only when Band 3 transmission frequency is less than or equal to
1765 MHz.
NOTE 18:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 19:	Void
NOTE 20:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.
NOTE 21:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.

NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the
exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic
emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval
centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the
2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth
(MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd
or 3rd harmonic spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RE
within the transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.4.2-1) for which the 2nd or 3rd harmonic, i.e. the
frequency equal to two or three times the frequency of that RE, is within the measurement
bandwidth (MBW).

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] subclause 6.6.3.2A.
This test use minimum requirements from many releases of TS 36.101 [2] due to release independence defined in TS
36.307 [16].
6.6.3.2A.1	Spurious emission band UE co-existence for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA
and UL CA)
6.6.3.2A.1.1	Test purpose

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration, which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1.
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg , only the first of those
is tested, according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure group A.33 as
appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3.2A.1.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.3.2A.1.4.3.
6.6.3.2A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.3.2A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.2A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3.2A.0-2a to 6.6.3.2A.0-2e. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according
to Table 6.6.3.2A.0-2a to 6.6.3.2A.0-2e. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement
period shall capture the active time slots.
6.6.3.2A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.6.3.2A.1.5	Test requirement
Test requirements for Spurious Emissions UE Co-existence are the same as the minimum requirements and are not
repeated in this section.
The measured average power of spurious emission, derived in step 6, shall not exceed the described value in Tables
6.6.3.2A.1.5-1.
The requirements for the UE are release specific and can be found in Tables 6.6.3.2A.0-2a to 6.6.3.2A.0-2e. If the UE
support a band, which is not defined in the table corresponding UE’s release, the requirements for this band are taken
from the table of earliest release where requirements for this band are defined. This has been described in following
Table 6.6.3.2A.1.5-1.

Note 1: 	CA Configuration Test CC Combination test settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration.
Note 2:	Use CA Configuration ? specific test points if present in the table. Otherwise use the Default Test Settings test
points.
Note 3:	X,Y correspond to the different bands in the CA Configuration. E.g. for CA_1A-19A,X=1,Y=19.
Note 4:	For CA configurations CA_1A-18A, CA_1A-19A, CA_1A-21A , CA_3A-19A and CA_18A-28A each test point
shall be tested. For all other CA configurations only test points with highest NRB_agg , according to UE supported
BCS shall be tested.
Note 5:	Test Point ID 7 for CA_3A-7A is applicable only for a Rel-13 and forward UE.
Note 6:	Test Point ID 3 and Test Point ID 8 for CA_2A-4A are applicable only for a Rel-14 and forward UE.
Note 7:	Test Point ID 4 for CA_1A-3A has the centre carrier frequency 1849.9 MHz, i.e. DL E-ARFCN is 1649.
Note 8:	Test Point ID 1, 4 and 8 for CA_41A-42A have the centre carrier frequency of 2635 MHz in Band 41
(EARFCN=41040).
Note 9:	Test Point ID 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 for CA_41A-42A has the centre carrier frequency of 2555 MHz in Band 41
(EARFCN=40240).
Note 10:	Test Point ID 7 for CA_41A-42A has the centre carrier frequency of 2674 MHz in Band 41 (EARFCN=41430).
Note 11:	Test Point ID 2 for CA_41A-42A has the centre carrier frequency of 3421 MHz in Band 42 (EARFCN=41800).

6.6.3.2A.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.3.2A.2.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.2A.2.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3.2A.2.5-1 to Table 6.3.2A.2.5-3. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps
according to Table 6.6.3.2A.2.5-1 to Table 6.6.3.2A.2.5-3. The measured power shall be verified for each step.
The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.
6.6.3.2A.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 4.6. In test procedure step 2, for SCC configuration there are no
additional message contents.
6.6.3.2A.2.5	Test requirement
The measured average power of spurious emission, derived in step 6, shall not exceed the described value in
Tables 6.6.3.2A.2.5-1 to 6.6.3.2A.2.5-3 according to the following rule:
The requirements for the UE are release specific and can be found in Tables 6.6.3.2A.2.5-1 to 6.6.3.2A.2.5-3. If the UE
supports a CA configuration, which is not defined in the table corresponding to UE’s release, the requirements for this
CA configuration are taken from the table of earliest release where requirements for this CA Configuration are defined.
This has been described in following Table 6.6.3.2A.2.5-0.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.2-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one
individual RB within the transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.4.2-1) for which the 2nd, 3rd or 4th
harmonic totally or partially overlaps the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 3:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1.3-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A.0-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
NOTE 4:	Void.
NOTE 5:	Void.
NOTE 6:	Void.
NOTE 7:	Void.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when NS_08 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.4 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 9:	Void.
NOTE10:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 11:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 12:	Void.
NOTE13:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 14:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 15:	Void.
NOTE 16:	Void.
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable only when Band 3 transmission frequency is less than or equal to
1765 MHz.
NOTE 18:	Void.
NOTE 19:	Void.
NOTE 20:	Void.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. In case the exceptions are allowed due to spreading of
the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range
immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in
an overall exception interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz),
where N is 2, 3 or 4 for the 2nd, 3rd or 4th harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the
measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
NOTE 4:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 5:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 6:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 7:	Applicable when NS_05 in section 6.6.3.3.3.2 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when NS_08 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.4 is signalled by the network
NOTE 9:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD.
NOTE10:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 11:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 12:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE13:	For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 14:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 15:	Applicable when NS_15 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.10 is signalled by the network.
NOTE 16:	Applicable when NS_09 in subclause 6.6.3.3.3.5 is signalled by the network
NOTE 17:	This requirement is applicable only when Band 3 transmission frequency is less than or equal to
1765 MHz.

requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.
NOTE 21:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.

Note 3:	The 16QAM configurations shall not apply to UEs which support UL 64QAM.

Editor’s note: The following lines belong at the end of section 6.2.4.4.1. As new tables are added to this section,
these lines should always follow the tables.
1.	Connect the SS to the UE to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure A.7.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3.3.4.1-1to Table 6.6.3.3.4.1-22
depending on network signal value.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.3.3.4.3.
6.6.3.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.3.4.1-1 to 6.6.3.3.4.1-22. Since the UE has no payload and no
loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Tables 6.2.4.5-1 to 6.2.4.5-27 for Power Class 3
UEs or 6.2.4_1.5-2 for Power Class 2 UEs as appropriate. The period of the measurement shall be at least one
sub-frame (1ms).
4.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3.3.5.1-1 to 6.6.3.3.5.21-1 as appropriate. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous
steps according to the same table. For NS_07 measurements made in a bandwidth of 6.25kHz, measurement
parameter settings defined in table 6.6.3.3.4.2-1 shall be used. The measured power shall be verified for each
step. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.

6.6.3.3_1.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Table 6.6.3.3_1.4.1-1 through Table 6.6.3.3_1.4.1-21. The
details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH
and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA Configuration which
applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-1

1.	Connect the SS to the UE to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure
group A.33 as appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-1, Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-2,
Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-3, Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-4, Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-5 or Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-6 depending on
network signal value.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.3.3A.1.4.3.
6.6.3.3A.1.4.2	Test procedure
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.3.3A.1.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3.3A.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC. Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Tables 6.2.4A.1.5-1 to 6.2.4A.1.5-7 as
appropriate. The period of the measurement shall be at least one sub-frame (1ms).
7.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3.3A.1.5.1-1, 6.6.3.3A.1.5.2-1, 6.6.3.3A.1.5.3-1, 6.6.3.3A.1.5.4-1, 6.6.3.3A.1.5.5-1 and 6.6.3.3A.1.5.6-1 as
appropriate. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to the same table.
The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.
6.6.3.3A.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6, with the following exceptions for each network
signalled value.

Note 1:	For CCs with NS_01, there are no additional requirements defined in 36.101. Only CCs with NS-value
different than NS_01 and present in 6.6.3.3.3 needs to be tested.
Note 2:	A-MPR values for NS-values in this table are the same as in section 6.2.4.3.
Note 3:	No test required since only A-Spur requirements apply, and the frequency range to test is unaffected by
intermodulation products as described in section 4.3 in TR 36.905.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and CC combinations based on
E-UTRA CA configurations specified in table 5.4.2A.1-2. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each CA Configuration, and are shown in tables 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-5. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	CA Configuration Test CC Combination settings are checked separately for each CA
Configuration. which applicable aggregated channel bandwidths are specified in Table 5.4.2A.1-
1
Note 2:	If in the CA Configuration UE supports multiple CC Combinations with the same NRB_agg. Only
the first of those is tested. according to the order on the Test Configuration Table list.
Note 3:	For Low range place test point with RBstart=0. For High range place test point with
RBstart=RBmax-LCRB+1.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Figure TS 36.508 [7] Annex A, Figure
group A.33 as appropriate.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals for PCC are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals
according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Tables 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-5
depending on network signal value.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.6.3.3A.2.4.3.
6.6.3.3A.2.4.2	Test procedures
1.	Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1 and Annex C.3.0 for all downlink physical channels.
2.	The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.4. Message contents are defined in clause
6.6.3.3A.2.4.3
3.	SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC-CE (Refer TS 36.321 [13], clauses 5.13, 6.1.3.8). Wait for at
least 2 seconds (Refer TS 36.133, clauses 8.3.3.2).
4.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Tables 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-5 as appropriate on both PCC and
SCC. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC.
5.	Send continuously uplink power control “up” commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE until
the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
6.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Tables 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-5 as
appropriate. The period of the measurement shall be at least one sub-frame (1ms).
7.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Tables
6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-2 to 6.6.3.3A.2.4.1-5 as appropriate. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
contiguous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The
measurement period shall capture the active time slots.
6.6.3.3A.2.4.3	Message contents
Same message contents as in clause 6.6.3.3.4.3.
6.6.3.3A.2.5	Test requirement

1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH DCI format 4 for C_RNTI to
schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3B.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal at each UE antenna connector with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to table 6.6.3B.1.5-1. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous
steps according to table 6.6.3B.1.5-1. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement
period shall capture the active time slots.
6.6.3B.1.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6.
6.6.3B.1.5	Test requirement
The measured average power of spurious emission, derived in step 3, shall not exceed the described value in table
6.6.3B.1.5-1.
The spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than ΔfOOB (MHz) from the edge of the

NOTE:	In order that the measurement of spurious emissions falls within the frequency ranges that are more than
ΔfOOB (MHz) from the edge of the channel bandwidth, the minimum offset of the measurement
frequency from each edge of the channel should be ΔfOOB + MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined in Table 6.6.3B.1.5-1.
6.6.3B.2	Spurious emission band UE co-existence for UL-MIMO
Editor's note: This test case contains different requirements for different UE releases
6.6.3B.2.1	Test purpose
To verify that UE transmitter with a UL-MIMO does not cause unacceptable interference to co-existing systems for the
specified bands which has specific requirements in terms of transmitter spurious emissions.
6.6.3B.2.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.6.3B.2.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements for Spurious emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products are specified at each transmit antenna connector.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors, the requirements in clause 6.6.3 apply to each transmit antenna with the
UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-1 for closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.6.3B.
This test use minimum requirements from many releases of TS 36.101 [2] due to release independence defined in TS
36.307 [16].
6.6.3B.2.4	Test description
6.6.3B.2.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters
for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Table 6.6.3B.2.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement

NOTE:	The frequency range applicable with network signalled values of NS_05, NS_08, and NS_09 are covered
in 6.6.3B.3 Additional Spurious Emissions for UL-MIMO.
6.6.3B.3	Additional spurious emissions for UL-MIMO
Editor's note:	This clause is incomplete. for Rel-10 as it is also testing Rel-11 minimum requirements.
6.6.3B.3.1	Test purpose
To verify that UE transmitter with a UL-MIMO does not cause unacceptable interference to other channels or other
systems in terms of transmitter spurious emissions under the deployment scenarios where additional requirements are
specified.
6.6.3B.3.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 10 and forward that support UL-MIMO.
6.6.3B.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
For UE with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements for Spurious emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products are specified at each transmit antenna connector.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors, the requirements in clause 6.6.3 apply to each transmit antenna with the
UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-1 for closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 36.101 [2] clause 6.6.3B.
6.6.3B.3.4	Test description
6.6.3B.3.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA operating bands specified in table 5.4.2.1-1. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters for each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Tables 6.6.3B.3.4.1-1 to 6.6.3B.3.4.1-19. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1.
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1.3-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the
exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic
emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval
centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th ] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth
(MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
Note 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band.
Note 4:	N/A
Note 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band.
Note 6:	N/A
Note 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception
is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th]
harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or
partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band
NOTE 4:	N/A
NOTE 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band
NOTE 6:	N/A
NOTE 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 9:	N/A
NOTE 10:	N/A
NOTE 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
NOTE 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
NOTE 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 14:	N/A
NOTE 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
NOTE 16:	N/A
NOTE 17:	N/A
NOTE 18:	N/A
NOTE 19:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 20:	N/A
NOTE 21:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc < 907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤ 912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 26: For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 28:	N/A
NOTE 29:	N/A
NOTE 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 31:	N/A
NOTE 33:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz
(requirement for carriers with at least 1RB confined within 1880 - 1885 MHz is not specified). This
requirement applies for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB for carriers of
15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1892.5 - 1894.5 MHz and for
carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within the range 1895 - 1903 MHz.
NOTE 34:	This requirement is applicable for 5 and 10 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 718-
728MHz. For carriers of 10 MHz bandwidth, this requirement applies for an uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to 30 RB with RBstart > 1 and RBstart<48.
NOTE 35:	This requirement is applicable in the case of a 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier confined within 703 MHz
and 733 MHz, otherwise the requirement of -25 dBm with a measurement bandwidth of 8 MHz
applies.
NOTE 36:	This requirement is applicable for E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within 1920-1980 MHz.
NOTE 37:	Applicable when the upper edge of the channel bandwidth frequency is greater than 1980MHz.
NOTE 38:	Applicable only for UE category M1 and NB1.

6.6.3EA.2.4	Test description
6.6.3EA.2.4.1	Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on
E-UTRA bands specified in clause 5.2E. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for
each channel bandwidth, and are shown in Table 6.6.3EA.2.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and MPDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

1.	Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508[7] Annex A Figure A.7 using only main
UE Tx/Rx antenna.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3EA.2.4.1-1.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-CE according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2AA. Message contents are defined

6.6.3EA.2.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3EA.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to
send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE until the
UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to table
6.6.3EA.2.3-1. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to table
6.6.3EA.2.5-1. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period shall capture the
active time slots.
6.6.3EA.2.4.3	Message contents
Message contents are according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.6 with the condition CEModeA.
6.6.3EA.2.5	Test requirement
Test requirements for Spurious Emissions UE Co-existence are the same as the minimum requirements and are not
repeated in this section.
The measured average power of spurious emission, derived in step 3, shall not exceed the described value in table
6.6.3EA.2.3-1 according to the following rule:
The requirements for the UE are release specific and can be found in Tables 6.6.3EA.2.3-1. If the UE support a band,
which is not defined in the table corresponding UE’s release, the requirements for this band are taken from the table of
earliest release where requirements for this band are defined. This has been described in following Table 6.6.3EA.2.5-1.

NOTE 1:	The following is applied to Note2 in Table 6.6.3EA.2.3-1. For frequency with 2nd, 3rd or 4th harmonic
spurious emissions, the measurements are covered in 6.6.3.1.
NOTE 2:	The restriction on the maximum uplink transmission to 36 RB in Notes 14 and 15 of Table 6.6.3EA.2.5-1
is intended for conformance testing and may be applied to network operation to facilitate coexistence
when the aggressor and victim bands are deployed in the same geographical area. The applicable spurious
emission requirement of -15.5 dBm/5MHz is a least restrictive technical condition for FDD/TDD
coexistence and may have to be revised in the future.6.6.3EA.3	Additional spurious emissions for UE
category M1
6.6.3EA.3	Additional spurious emissions for UE category M1
Editor's note:	Following aspects missing or not yet determined:
- Test configuration tables and test requirement tables FFS for NS_12
6.6.3EA.3.1	Test purpose
To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference to other channels or other systems in terms of
transmitter spurious emissions under the deployment scenarios where additional requirements are specified.
6.6.3EA.3.2	Test applicability
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 13 and forward of UE category M1.
6.6.3EA.3.3	Minimum conformance requirements
These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum emission requirement. Additional spurious
emission requirements are signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast message.
NOTE:	For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the lowest frequency of the
measurement position in each frequency range should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency
range plus MBW/2. The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should
be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement
bandwidth defined for the protected band.
6.6.3EA.3.3.1	Minimum requirement (network signalled value "NS_05")
When "NS_05" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table

Tx/Rx antenna.
2.	The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 36.508 [7] subclause 4.4.3.
3.	Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C0, C.1 and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to
Annex H.1 and H.3.0.
4.	The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table 6.6.3EA.3.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.3EA.3.4.1-11.
5.	Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.
6.	Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF-CE according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 5.2A.2AA. Message contents are defined
in clause 6.6.3EA.3.4.3.
6.6.3EA.3.4.2	Test procedure
1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via MPDCCH DCI format 6-0A for
C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.6.3EA.3.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.3EA.3.4.1-11 depending on
NS-value. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC
2.	Send continuously uplink power control "up" commands in the uplink scheduling information to the UE to
ensure that the UE transmits at PUMAX level.
3.	Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in Tables 6.2.4EA.5-1 to 6.2.4EA.5-17 as
appropriate. The period of measurement shall be at least the continuous duration one sub-frame (1ms). For TDD
slots with transient periods are not under test. For HD-FDD slots with transient periods and Half-duplex guard
subframe are not under test.
4.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to Table
6.6.3EA.3.1-1, 6.6.3EA.3.3.3-1 to 6.6.3EA.3.3.11-1, and 6.6.3EA.3.5.1-1 as appropriate. The centre frequency of
the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to the same table. For NS_07 measurements made in a
bandwidth of 6.25kHz, measurement parameter settings defined in table 6.6.3EA.3.4.2-1 shall be used. The
measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.

Note 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1.
Note 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3F.1.3-1 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the
exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic
emission on both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval
centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd,
3rd, 4th [or 5th] harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth
(MBW) totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.

Note 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
Note 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE
to reach the correct measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions and test frequencies based on the subset of E-UTRA
operating bands defined for NB-IoT in clause 5.2F. All of these configurations shall be tested with applicable test
parameters, and are shown in Table 6.6.3F.2.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs)
are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of NPDSCH and NPDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1.	SS sends uplink scheduling information via NPDCCH DCI format N0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 6.6.3F.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC (UE should be already transmitting PUMAX after Initial Conditions
setting).
2.	Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of bandwidths according to tables
6.6.3F.2.3-1 to 6.6.3F.2.3-1A. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to
table 6.6.3F.2.5-1. The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period shall capture the
active time slots.
NOTE 1:	For configuration IDs applicable to UE depending on UE capability in Test Configuration Table with
different UL sub-carrier spacing, the SS shall release the connection through State 3A-NB and finally
ensure the UE is in State 2A-NB with CP CIoT Optimisation according to TS 36.508 [7] clause 8.1.5
using the appropriate UL subcarrier spacing in Random Access Response message.

NOTE 1:	FDL_low and FDL_high refer to each E-UTRA frequency band specified in Table 5.5-1
NOTE 2:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd, 3rd,
4th [or 5th] harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception
is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x LCRB x 180kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th [or 5th]
harmonic respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or
partially overlaps the overall exception interval.
NOTE 3:	To meet these requirements some restriction will be needed for either the operating band or
protected band
NOTE 4:	N/A
NOTE 5:	For non synchronised TDD operation to meet these requirements some restriction will be needed
for either the operating band or protected band
NOTE 6:	N/A
NOTE 7:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5	-1919.6MHz.
NOTE 8:	Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 -1915.7MHz.
NOTE 9:	N/A
NOTE 10:	N/A
NOTE 11:	Whether the applicable frequency range should be 793-805MHz instead of 799-805MHz is TBD
NOTE 12:	The emissions measurement shall be sufficiently power averaged to ensure a standard deviation <
0.5 dB
NOTE 13:	This requirement applies for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz E-UTRA channel bandwidth allocated within
1744.9MHz and 1784.9MHz.
NOTE 14:	N/A
NOTE 15:	These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1A-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.
NOTE 16:	N/A
NOTE 17:	N/A
NOTE 18:	N/A
NOTE 19:	Applicable when the assigned E-UTRA carrier is confined within 718 MHz and 748 MHz and when
the channel bandwidth used is 5 or 10 MHz.
NOTE 20:	N/A
NOTE 21:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2500 - 2570 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2560.5 - 2562.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2552 - 2560 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 22:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 2570 - 2615 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 2605.5 - 2607.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 2597 - 2605 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
For carriers with channel bandwidth overlapping the frequency range 2615 - 2620 MHz the
requirement applies with the maximum output power configured to +19 dBm in the IE P-Max.
NOTE 23:	This requirement is applicable only for the following cases:
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
902.5 MHz ≤ Fc <  907.5 MHz with an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 20 RB
- for carriers of 5 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is within the range
907.5 MHz ≤ Fc ≤  912.5 MHz without any restriction on uplink transmission bandwidth.
- for carriers of 10 MHz channel bandwidth when carrier centre frequency (Fc) is Fc = 910 MHz with
an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 32 RB with RBstart > 3.
NOTE 24:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -38 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 2nd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 2nd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 25:	As exceptions, measurements with a level up to the applicable requirement of -36 dBm/MHz is
permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the measurement due to 3rd harmonic
spurious emissions. An exception is allowed if there is at least one individual RB within the
transmission bandwidth (see Figure 5.6-1) for which the 3rd harmonic totally or partially overlaps
the measurement bandwidth (MBW).
NOTE 26: For these adjacent bands, the emission limit could imply risk of harmful interference to
UE(s) operating in the protected operating band.
NOTE 27:	This requirement is applicable for any channel bandwidths within the range 1920 - 1980 MHz with
the following restriction: for carriers of 15 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre frequency is within
the range 1927.5 - 1929.5 MHz and for carriers of 20 MHz bandwidth when carrier centre
frequency is within the range 1930 - 1938 MHz the requirement is applicable only for an uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to 54 RB.
NOTE 28:	N/A
NOTE 29:	N/A
NOTE 30:	This requirement applies when the E-UTRA carrier is confined within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-
2645MHz and the channel bandwidth is 10 or 20 MHz
NOTE 31:	N/A
NOTE 32:	Void
NOTE 33:	This requirement is only applicable for carriers with bandwidth confined within 1885-1920 MHz

6.7A	Transmit intermodulation for CA
6.7A.0	Minimum conformance requirements
User Equipment(s) transmitting in close vicinity of each other can produce intermodulation products, which can fall into
the UE, or eNode B receive band as an unwanted interfering signal. The UE intermodulation attenuation is defined by
the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product on both component
carriers when an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each of the transmitter antenna
port with the other antenna port(s) if any is terminated. Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product
power are measured through rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6.7A.0-1.
For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA bands, the requirement is specified in Table
6.7.3-1 which shall apply on each component carrier with both component carriers active.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the requirement of transmitting intermodulation is specified in Table
6.7A.0-1.

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of
signals in its non linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna.
The UE category NB1 transmitter intermodulation attenuation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted
signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product as defined in Table 6.7F.3-1 when an interfering CW signal is
added at a level below the wanted signal at the transmitter antenna port. Both the wanted signal power and the
intermodulation product power are measured through rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table
6.7F.3-1.
